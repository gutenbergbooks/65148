<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>What</span> is so beautiful as childhood? Where can
we find such purity and frankness, such an absence of
all selfishness, as in the love of children? And
where does that love exist, deeper or sweeter or more
like that of heaven than when between a brother and
a sister?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brother and sister! what a spell in the very words!
How they bring up to our mind visions of days long
past, and such, alas! as we shall never see again;
when, with that dear one who is now in heaven, singing
among the white-robed choir around the throne of
God, we wandered over hill and dale, through fields
of waving corn and meadows of the freshest grass—and
all the while drinking into our souls sensations
we could not then understand, but which we now
know sprung from that sympathy which exists between
us and every beautiful thing in nature, and
which, beginning at the humblest flower, links together
all inanimate and animate creation, ascending
step by step from tree to breathing thing, from
breathing thing to man, from man to the angels, and
so through cherubim and seraphim and archangel, up
to the highest intelligence who veils his face before
the effulgence of the great <span class='sc'>I am</span>. We little knew
the reason then, but we felt how sweet it was to wander
thus—often from morning until night—threading
the old wood, or gathering flowers on the lea, or
playing merrily beneath some shady grove, or loitering
perchance at noon-day beside the stream, to gaze
at the silvery trout glancing far down in the cool
depths, or hanging like a motionless statue close
under the mossy rocky caves that skirted the banks.
Oh! those were delicious hours. Arm in arm would
we sit, scarce speaking a word for hours, but with a
thousand sweet though indescribable emotions at our
hearts, until a dreamy quiet would creep over our
souls like that which lapped the poet into Elysium.
The very soughing of the wind among the trees
would become lower and softer, until it died away
with a tone as mellow as that of a flute at midnight.
The current would sweep noiselessly at our feet, save
when it whirled by some projecting rock, or babbled
over a pebbly bar on the bosom of the stream. Now
the whirr of a woodcock might be heard, and now the
whistle of a wild pigeon broke clear and silvery on
the silence. Often the long tresses of the overhanging
willows drooped down around us until they slept
upon the waters, while ever and anon the noon-tide
breeze would rustle the neighboring trees, and a
sound would go up like the whispers of a company
of angels. How often have we thought that in these
low mysterious tones might exist a meaning of which
we little dream, a language as full of adoration as it
is of harmony. But be that as it may, is not all
nature an instrument from which the fingers of God
are drawing perpetual music? The roar of the surf,
the whisper of the zephyr, the rustling of the forest,
the gurgling of the stream, the song of the bird, the
low of the kine, the rain gently pattering among the
forest leaves, and the thunder wheeling and rattling
among the hills, are all notes in that great anthem
of praise which continually goes up from earth—an
anthem which is swelled by the music of satellites
and worlds, aye! of a revolving universe, sweeping
sphere on sphere beyond the ken of man. All creation
is but one vast whole, engaged day and night in
hymning Jehovah’s praise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brother and sister! Alas! we are alone. Manhood
has left us of that happy time only these emotions—first
felt in the companionship of that now sainted
being. But never shall we forget those days.
They are linked in with our very being. How many
sweet emotions, how many lasting impressions, how
many glimpses of the beautiful and true were drawn
into our souls in that joyous time of innocence and
youth. And how all seem the sweeter, and holier,
and more enduring from the associations connected
with them. Oh! tell us not of other’s love, it cannot
surpass that of a sister. What can be purer
than her little caresses, what can be more heavenly
than her smile? Years have passed since the days
when we thus wandered together, and the cares of
the world have eaten like a canker into our heart,
but the memory of that sister’s kindness and the
consciousness of her affection, have been a balm to
our hearts in every ill. They have cheered us in
sickness, and sorrow, and absence; they have been
to us beacons of hope and happiness. And they will
continue with us, thank God! until we too shall
have done with the toils of life.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY PERCIE H. SELTON.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Do</span> you see that landscape?” said the old man to
me, as we paused on the edge of the mountain road,
and looked down into the valley of Wyoming beneath
us. “Well, that spot, calm and beautiful as it now
is, was once the scene of massacre. God help me!
the agonies of that day almost wring my heart to
think of them, even after the lapse of fifty years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have heard it was a fearful time, and you have
often promised to tell me the tale of your own connection
with it. Yet, if the subject be so painful to
you, I dare scarcely make the request.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, boy, no,” said the old man, sadly, “I will
tell it, for the promise is of long standing, and I feel
to-day as if I could narrate that tragedy with less
emotion than usual. Sit down on this rock, and give
me a moment to rest; I will then commence my
story.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the old man wiped the perspiration from his
brow, and sat fanning himself with his broad-rimmed
summer hat, I took the place pointed out by him
near his side, and spent the moments that elapsed
before he began his narration in gazing at the landscape
before me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sitting on a huge boulder, at the edge of the mountain,
just where the hill began to slope down into
the valley, we commanded a view of one of the most
unrivalled landscapes in the world. To our left rose
up the mountain, bold, rugged and barren, like the
back of some vast monster reared against the sky—but
on the right nothing interposed to destroy the
view: whose loveliness so far exceeded even my
expectations, that for some minutes I gazed on the
scene in mute admiration. Beneath me stretched
the valley, diversified with gently sloping elevations,
and sprinkled with fields of waving golden
grain; while here and there a patch of woodland,
with its dark green hue, lay slumbering on the
landscape—the surface of the forest ever and anon
varying to a lighter tint as the wind swept over
the tree-tops. Right through the centre of the valley
meandered the river, now rolling betwixt bluff banks,
and now stealing gently among the rich meadow
lands in the distance, until at length it turned to the
left, and, skirting the foot of the far off hills, was lost
behind the profile of the mountain before us. In the
centre of the vale was the village, with its white
houses and airy church steeple, smiling over the scene.
Far away on the horizon stretched a line of hills,
their dark blue summits, half hid by the clouds, which
wrapped them as in a veil of gauze. No sound came
up from the valley. Occasionally the twitter of
a bird would be heard from the surrounding trees—while
the low tinkle of a tiny waterfall on our left
kept monotonously sounding in our ears. The morning
rays of a summer’s sun poured down upon the
landscape, and every thing around was bright, and
gay, and beautiful. I was still lost in admiration at
the loveliness of the scene, when the old man signified
his readiness to commence his tale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is now fifty years ago,” he began, “since I
came to this valley a young frontier-man, with a
hardy constitution, a love of adventure, and the reputation
of being the best shot on the border: the place
was, at that time, settled principally by families
from Connecticut, and even then bore traces of its
present luxuriant cultivation. Many of the families
were in good circumstances, others had seen better
days—and altogether the society was more refined
than was usual on the frontier. Among all the families,
however, in the valley, none pleased me so much
as that of Mr. Beverly—and, of his fireside circle
his second daughter, Kate, was, in my eyes, the gem.
How shall I describe her beauty? Lovely, without
being beautiful, with a sylph-like form, a laugh as
joyous as the carol of a bird, a step lighter than that
of a young fawn in sportive play, and a disposition so
amiable as to win, irresistibly, the love of all who
met her. Kate Beverly was scarcely seventeen before
she had a host of admirers, and might have won any
youth in the valley. Why it was that she preferred
me over all the rest, I cannot say: perhaps it was
the consciousness of some mysterious sympathy
linking us together, or perhaps it was that we both
came from the same town in Connecticut, and had
been school-mates in childhood—so it was, however.
It soon began to be known throughout the valley that
before another season should elapse, Kate Beverly
would become my wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! how happy were those days—too happy,
indeed, to last. I will not dwell upon them, for they
fill my soul with agony. Suffice it to say, that while
dreaming of bliss such as mortal never before experienced,
the war of the revolution broke out—and,
after a hard struggle between my passion and my
duty, the latter conquered, and I joined the army.
Kate did not attempt to dissuade me from the act—she
rather loved me the more for it. Though her
woman nature caused her to shed tears at my departure,
her reason told her I was right, and she bid me
God speed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Heaven bless you, Harry,’ she said, ‘and bring
this unnatural war to a conclusion. I cannot bid you
stay, but I pray that the necessity for your absence
may soon cease.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Time rolled by—the American cause was still
doubtful, and the war bid fair to be protracted into
years. I had risen to be a captain in the —— regiment,
when I received information that the tories
and Indians intended making a descent on the valley
of the Wyoming. I knew the unprotected situation
of my adopted district, and I trembled for the lives
of those I held most dear. At first I discredited the
rumor—chance, however, threw in my way an opportunity
of ascertaining the reality of the reported
descent, and I became convinced that not a moment
was to be lost if I would save the lives of those I
loved at home. My determination was at once
taken—I solicited for leave of absence—it was refused:
I then resigned my commission, and set forth
to Wyoming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never shall forget my emotions when I drew
near that ill-fated place; it was on the very day of
the massacre—and the first intimation I had of the
calamity was the mangled body of one of the inhabitants,
whom I had known, floating down the stream.
A cold shiver ran through every vein as I gazed on
the terrible sight, and a thousand fears agitated my
bosom; but my worst surmises fell far short of the
truth. When, hours after, I met some of the fugitives,
and they rehearsed to me that tale of horror,
I stood for a moment thunderstruck, refusing to
believe that beings in human form could perpetrate
such deeds—but it was all too true.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Almost my first inquiry was for Kate. No one
knew, alas! what had become of her. One of those
who had escaped the fight, told me that her father
had been killed at the beginning of the conflict—and
that, deprived of a protector, she had probably fallen
a victim to the infuriate savages, while the other inhabitants
were severally engaged in protecting themselves.
How I cursed them for this selfishness! And
yet could I expect aught else of human nature, than
that each one should protect those dearest to them,
even to the desertion of others?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But my mind was soon made up. I resolved,
come what might, to ascertain clearly the fate of
Kate—so that if dead I might revenge her, and if,
living, I might rescue her. Bidding farewell to the
flying group, I shouldered my rifle and struck boldly
into the forest, trusting in the guidance of that God
who never deserts us in our extremities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will not tire you with a protracted narrative; I
will only say that, after numerous inquiries from the
fugitives I met, I learned that Kate had been last
seen in the hands of a party of savages,—this was
sufficient for a clue,—I once more began to hope.
I waited until night-fall, when I sought the spot which
had been described to me as the one where Kate had
been last seen—and, never shall I forget my feelings
of almost rapturous pleasure, when I found in the
neighboring forest a fragment of her dress sticking on
a bush, by which it had, doubtless, been torn from her
in passing. I was now satisfied that Kate had been
carried off captive. Fortunately I had met, in the
group of fugitives, a hunter who had been under some
obligations to her family, and he was easily persuaded
to join me in my search. Together we now
began a pursuit of the savages. He was an adept in
forest warfare—could follow a trail as a hound the
chase—knew the course which would be most likely
to be chosen by a flying party of Indians, and withal,
was one of the keenest shots who had carried a rifle
on the border.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘It’s my opinion,’ said he, ‘that these varmint
did not belong to the regular body of Indians who
followed Butler, though even they were bad enough.
I think, however, he wouldn’t suffer a deed like this.
These villains seem to have acted on their own behalf—and,
if so, they would fly to the back country
as soon as possible. You may depend upon it we
shall overtake them if we pursue that way.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I felt the truth of these remarks, and assented to
them at once. In less than a quarter of an hour after
first discovering the trail, we were threading the
forest in pursuit of the savages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me hasten to the close. Hour after hour,
all through the livelong day, we pursued the flying
Indians—crossing swamps, clambering over rocks,
fording streams, and picking our way through the
labyrinthine woods, until, towards night-fall, we
reached the edge of an open space—or, as it were, a
meadow, shut in by gently sloping hills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Hist,’ said my companion, ‘we are upon them.
Do you not see that thin thread of smoke curling upward
over the top of yonder aged hemlock?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Ay—it must be them—let us on.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Softly, or we lose all. We know not, certainly,
that this is the party we seek; let us reconnoitre.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Slowly and stealthily, trembling lest even a twig
should crackle under our feet, we crept up towards
the edge of the meadow—and peeping cautiously
through the underwood, beheld the objects of our
search in six tall swarthy savages, sitting smoking
around the remains of a fire. At a little distance
knelt, with her hands bound, but her eyes upraised
to heaven, my own Kate. Oh! how my heart leaped
at the sight. I raised my rifle convulsively, and was
about to fire, when my companion caught my hand,
and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Softly, or you spoil all. Let us get the varmint
in range, and then we shall fire with some effect.
Hist!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This last exclamation was occasioned by the sudden
rising of one of the savages. He gazed a moment
cautiously around, and then advanced towards the
thicket where we lay concealed. I drew my breath
in, and trembled at the beating of my own heart.
The savage still approached. My companion laid his
hand on my arm, and pointed from my rifle to one of
the Indians. I understood him. At this juncture the
advancing savage, warned of our presence by the
crackling of an unlucky twig beneath my companion’s
foot, sprang back, with a loud yell, towards the
fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Now,’ said my companion, sternly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quick as lightning I raised my piece and fired.
My companion did the same. The retreating savage
and one of his companions fell dead on the ground:
each of us then sprang to a tree, loading as we ran.
It was well we did it, for in an instant the enemy
was on us. Shall I describe that dreadful fight? My
emotion forbids it. A few minutes decided it. Fighting
from tree to tree—dodging, loading, and endeavoring
to get sight on a foe, we kept up the conflict
for nearly five minutes—at the end of which time I
found myself wounded, while four out of the six savages
lay prostrate on the ground. The other two, finding
their companions dead, and despairing of being
able to carry off their prisoner, suddenly rushed on
her, and before we could interpose, had seized their
hapless victim. I had only been prevented, hitherto,
from rescuing Kate by the knowledge that an attempt
of the kind, while the savages were still numerically
superior to us, would end in the certain ruin of us
both,—but now, worlds could not have restrained
me, and, clubbing my rifle, for the piece was unloaded,
I dashed out from my covert, shouting to my
companion—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘On—on, in God’s name, on.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Take care of the taller varmint,’ thundered my
companion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The warning was too late. In the tumult of my
feelings I had not observed that the savage furthest
from me had his piece loaded, and before I could
avail myself of my companion’s cooler observation,
I received the ball in my right arm, and my rifle
dropped powerless by my side; had I not sprung involuntarily
aside at my companion’s cry, I should
have been shot through the heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘On—on,’ I groaned in agony, as I seized my
tomahawk in my almost useless left hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Stoop,’ said my companion, ‘stoop lower;’ and
as I did so, his rifle cracked on the still air, and the
Indian fell dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All this had not occupied an instant. I was now
within a few feet of her I loved, who was struggling
in the grasp of the other Indian. He had already
entwined his hands in her long hair—his tomahawk
was already gleaming in the setting sun. Never shall
I forget the look of demoniac fury with which the
wretch glared on his victim. A second only was left
for hope. My companion was far behind, with his
rifle unloaded. I made a desperate spring forward,
and hurled my tomahawk at the savage’s head. God
of my fathers! the weapon whizzed harmlessly by
the wretch, and buried itself, quivering, in the trunk
of a neighboring tree. I groaned aloud in agony,—there
was a yell of triumph on the air—a sudden
flashing in the sun, like a glancing knife, and—but I
cannot go on. She I loved as my own life; she who
was the purest and loveliest of her sex; she with
whom I had promised myself a long life of happiness—oh!
must I say it—<span class='it'>she</span> lay a mangled corpse
at my feet! But her murderer, aye!—<span class='it'>he</span> was cloven
to the breast by a blow from his own tomahawk,
which I had wrenched from him with the strength of
a dozen men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man ceased,—big tears rolled down his
furrowed face, and his frame shook with emotion. I
saw the remembrance of the past was too much for
him, and I sat by his side in silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I subsequently heard his sad tale from others, and
then learned the manner in which Kate had been carried
off. The old man’s companion was right—she
had been made a prisoner by a predatory band of
Indians, who had followed Butler, and deserted him
directly after the massacre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beautiful as the Valley of the Wyoming is, I never
have seen it, from that day to this, without thinking
of the sad fate of <span class='sc'>Kate Beverly</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> was on a cold, bleak evening in autumn, that
Leslie Pierpoint, as described in Part First of our
tale, sat in his arm-chair in his comfortable library,
with his feet buried in a thick rug of Angola fleece;
a cheerful fire glowing in the grate; a round stand
with the tea-tray at his left elbow; and a large table
covered with magazines, papers, books, &amp;c. &amp;c., on
his right hand. He was alone. The rich, crimson
curtains drawn closely across the deep windows with
the comfortable air of the whole room, gave indication
that the occupant loved his ease, and was that
evening disposed to enjoy it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Twenty years had passed since Leslie’s <span class='it'>affaire du
cœur</span> with Clara Clayton. With her treachery expired
his confidence in the sex. In vain had the
lovely, gay and fashionable women thrown their
gilded nets. In every one of the fair fishers he but
saw a cousin german to Clara, and warily shunned
the danger. Thus had he reached forty-one years of
age with the full consent of all his friends, male and
female, that he should remain a bachelor for life.
And to all appearances such seemed to be the settled
destiny of Leslie Pierpoint. He himself had no more
thoughts of committing matrimony than suicide. He
never spake to any woman save his washerwoman
and linen sempstress. His mother had been several
years dead, and he lived alone—a bachelor! the
victim of a heartless woman’s treachery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He now sat gazing into the fire with a cup of tea
in his hand, and which he seemed to have forgotten
that he held. The state house clock tolled seven
and he started, laid down his cup and saucer, and
rang the bell. It was immediately answered by a
very gentlemanly African servant in grey clothes
with bright steel buttons, red cravat, and shoes with
old fashioned paste buckles in them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cato.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sar, massa?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have my new linens come home yet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, massa, not yit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They were to be here at six. Go and see that
they are sent in time to pack into my trunks to-night,
for we must start for New York early.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, massa,” said Cato, with a graceful bow,
and was in the act of leaving the room to obey his
master’s orders, when a ringing at the street door
bell arrested him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess dem is de sharts now, massa.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go and see, and show the woman up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cato left the room, while Leslie took up the evening
paper. Directly the servant reappeared, ushering
in a very modest young girl, coarse in her dress,
but of extraordinary beauty. She was scarcely
seventeen, yet the womanly outline and youthful
roundness of her sylph-like figure were perfect. Her
complexion was very brilliant; her cheeks blushed
with diffidence and beauty; her eyes were large,
blue, and melting in their own cerulean heaven; her
lips ripe and full, and her chin voluptuously rounded,
yet most exquisitely turned. Native grace was in
every movement she made. Her dress was of very
plain calico, and she wore a common straw hat with
a long green veil. In her hands she carried two
bundles, very neatly done up in white paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“De sharts come,” said Cato, making a low bow
to Leslie’s back. “Here de young woman wid ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, Cato; remove the tea-tray. I will
ring for you to show the woman out soon as I have
settled with her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, massa;” and the black, taking the tray in
his hands, cast a glance, first at the beautiful face of
the young girl, then over his shoulder at his master,
and, gravely shaking his grey pate, left the library.
Leslie completed the paragraph he was reading, and
then, lifting his face and looking into the fire, but
without turning round, said in the low, pleasant tone
natural to him:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So, my good woman, you have brought the shirts.
They have come an hour later than you promised
them, but I suppose you are very much hurried with
work. They are in plenty time, however. Be so
kind as to undo the package and let me see one of
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a few moments there was no sound in the
room but the snapping of strings, as they were untied
by the busy fingers of the linen-draper’s maid, and
the rattling of the strong paper covering the linens.
At length a shirt, white as the drifted snow and
beautifully done up, was hesitatingly advanced over
his shoulder, so as to intercept his vision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took it, and after carefully examining it (old
bachelors are very particular in this matter) with an
appearance of satisfaction, admiring the stitching of
the wristbands, the French style of the sleeves, and
the neatness of the bosom folds, he laid it down beside
him where the tea tray had stood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, my good woman, I am very much pleased
with them. They are very neatly made. Please let
me see your bill.” And he turned his head slightly
back to receive it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young girl, embarrassed by his mode of addressing
her, and abashed at his presence, timidly
stretched forth her hand containing the bill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nearer, woman, nearer. I cannot reach it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Agitated by his voice, she thrust her arm forward
so quickly that he received in his grasp her hand as
well as her bill. The sight and touch of the soft,
white member, thrilled through him. He started,
blushed, rose from his chair, and to his surprise discovered
that he had been all the while talking to one
of the loveliest girls of seventeen he had ever seen,
instead of an old woman, whom he supposed was the
bearer of his linens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pardon me, miss—I beg pardon,” said the Major
embarrassed, “I thought you were your mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have no mother, sir,” answered the pretty
maiden, with a drooping eyelid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg pardon! Sit down! No, you may stand!
Upon my word you are very beautiful.” The Major
hardly knew what he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir, the bill if you please,” said the maiden confused,
her bright intelligent face suffused with crimson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, ah! sit down if you please! no—stand up;
no, no, no! <span class='it'>sit down!</span>” Poor Major Pierpoint!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I thank you, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a sweet voice,” soliloquized the Major to
himself. “No mother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir,” with a musical sadness in her voice,
touching as it was natural.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No father?” asked the Major with as much delicacy
as he could put the question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No brothers, neither, I dare say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor sisters, either?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ho! hah, hem!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Major, having finished catechising her,
put his hands behind his back and looked steadily in
the grate for full a minute, his lips compressed, his
brow set and thoughtful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you please, sir, the bill is waiting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Major started at the sound of the sweet voice
as if he had been clapped on the shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, ah! I beg your pardon. Let me see—six
linen shirts—five dollars each—thirty dollars—all
right.” And the Major looked up from the bill into
her face. He felt a delight he could not account for
in gazing upon its sweet beauty. She was confused
by his ardent look, and became still more beautiful
from her sweet confusion. With instinctive delicacy
he withdrew his gaze, and a sigh, the first he had
felt for twenty years, escaped him. A gentle sadness
at the same time overspread his fine features.
Again he looked into her face, but with an expression
that she did not shrink from, and said kindly, touchingly,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So then, sweet child, you are an orphan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mary Lee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A pretty name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir, I have another errand to go—if you will
please pay the bill for my mistress.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, ah! yes, the bill. Thirty dollars. Here is
a check for the amount.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thank you, sir,” said Mary, curtseying with a
grace that charmed him, and turning to leave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stay, Mary—that is, Miss Lee,” said Leslie,
following her a step and speaking with amusing hesitation.
The linen-draper maiden had, however,
reached the door and placed her hand upon the lock.
She was evidently alarmed and surprised, and seemed
uncertain whether to take the gentleman’s manner
as rudeness or as an uncommon degree of civility.
She appeared to be a sensible, good natured girl,
however, with all her charms, and probably with
woman’s ready tact divined the true cause of his
singular conduct. Yet with all a woman’s tact she
pretended to be blind to the impression her beauty
had made upon him. She could not help thinking
that he was a very handsome man, if he was an old
bachelor, and she felt pleased rather than offended
at this evidence of the triumph of beauty. For Mary
Lee well knew she had beauty, and what pretty miss
of seventeen is ignorant of this possession?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stay, if you please, one moment, Miss Lee,”
said Leslie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, sir, it is late.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But one moment. Are you an apprentice with
Miss Phelps, the linen-draper?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir;” and Mary turned the lock of the
door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Major laid his hand lightly upon her wrist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Excuse me, Miss Lee! One more question!”
But the maiden, with a pleasant laugh, threw off his
hand and bounded through the open door into the
hall. Cato was in waiting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, Cato,” said the Major, with as much coolness
as he could summon at this crisis, “you save
me the trouble of ringing. Show this young woman
out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sar,” said Cato.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Major Pierpoint lingered an instant in his door to
follow with his eye the receding form of the maiden,
as with a light, graceful trip she followed the dignified
Cato to the street door. He then re-entered his
library, and after pacing his room two or three times
as if his thoughts were in a tumult, he suddenly
stopped before his mirror and looked at himself.
After a brief and satisfied survey of his fine face and
person he walked to the fire, folded his hands behind
his back, and stood and looked into the grate with a
very thoughtful brow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Leslie Pierpoint, after remaining bachelor
twenty years, thou art made captive by a linen-draper’s
’prentice! ’Tis true, and pity ’tis, ’tis true!
Leslie Pierpoint, thou art false to thyself! But what
a soft, sweet hand! How could I help taking it if she
would thrust it into mine? But, poor child, I suppose
I had frightened her by calling her an old woman,
and she scarcely knew what she was about! Old
woman? A youthful divinity! What heavenly blue
eyes! What a sweet round bust! What an exquisite
waist, the charms of which even her coarse dress
could not conceal! And her foot, so petite and delicately
turned! How rich were the tones of her
voice! How enchanting her smile! Ah, Leslie Pierpoint,
thou art in love with a ’prentice maiden! At
forty years thou art become a fool! Yes, I am a
fool! What have I to do with the sex? Have I not
a lasting feud with it? Ah, let me not forget Clara
Clayton! Remember her, and so forget this pretty
maiden, for she belongs to the same false hearted
sex!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus soliloquized Major Pierpoint, and, turning
from the fire, he walked his room some time with a
thoughtful brow. All at once he stopped and pulled
his bell with an emphasis. Cato made his instant
appearance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sar, massa.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bring me my boots.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What massa say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bring me my boots,” repeated Leslie, more decidedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The black left the room with an inquiring look, as
much as to ask what could take his master out in
such an evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I will do it. I will learn all about her!
Such beautiful teeth! Such a bright, intelligent,
sensible face! Such innate high breeding!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cato brought the boots, and in a few minutes afterwards
the Major had exchanged his evening home
costume for boots, overcoat and hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My stick, Cato.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sar,” answered the black with dilating
eyes, as he handed the gold headed Indian cane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall return in an hour, Cato,” he said, as his
wondering servant showed him out of the street door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sar,” and Cato closed the door on his master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, if massa Peerpount hant a loss his sebenteen
senses, den heabenly marcy nebber gave Cato
any. De firs’ time I ebber know him go out after
him once take his boot off! Someting ’ticklar be
goin’ to happ’n for sartain! No disordinary circumcasion
take massa Peerpoun’ out dis col’ ebening. I
mus’ feel werry pertickler distress if as how any ting
surreptitious occur.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus commented honest Cato upon this unusual
step of his master’s, whose general habits were so
regular that each day he went through the same routine
of eating, sleeping, smoking, reading, and walking
or riding. He had never gone out in an evening
before. Cato had cause, therefore, for marvel; and
leaving him to his conjectures on the motive for this
strange movement on the part of his master, we will
follow him on his expedition. The evening was clear
but cold and windy, and he wrapped his coat closer
about his person as he entered Chesnut street from
Sixth, and took his way past the hotel and theatre
which were brilliant with lamps, and gay and lively
with the moving things about their doors. Heedless
of these, he kept on until he came to Third street,
which he followed north for a few doors, where he
stopped beneath a lamp and turned back the cape of
his surtout, arranged his slightly awry cravat, and
made such other little toilet reparations as young
gentlemen are accustomed to do before going into a
house to pay a visit to ladies. Having <span class='it'>fixed</span> himself
to his satisfaction, though without a mirror, (men of
taste are a glass to themselves!) he walked more
deliberately onward and entered a door over which
hung a sign reading “<span class='sc'>Mrs. Phelps’ Gentlemen’s
Linen Store</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A very pleasant looking widow-like person presided
in the brilliantly lighted shop behind the counter,
while there were glimpses of two or three girls at
their work in the rear room, and a little old woman
in spectacles tying up bundles—doubtless the identical
“old woman” whom the Major had imagined
he was talking to as the bearer of his package.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good evening, Mrs. Phelps,” said the Major
politely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, Major Pierpoint, good evening, sir,” said
Mrs. Phelps with very great respect, for the Major
was a monied customer and never disputed bills!
“Lord me! I hope you haven’t come after the
shirts!” she said with apologetic volubility; “they
have been gone this half hour! I was so hurried,
Major, I couldn’t get them done at the precise hour
you ordered them, though I know you are so very
particular. But soon as they came into the shop,
lest you should get impatient, as your black man
said you were going out of town early in the morning,
I despatched one of my apprentices right off with
’em, knowing she would go quicker than aunt Dolly
here, who is always mighty slow in cold weather.
If you come right from home you ought to had ’em
there! If Mary has taken that bundle of hemmed
handkerchiefs to Miss Clayton’s first, I shall give
her a good scolding; for I told her, Major, pertickerlaly,
to go and leave your package first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind all this, my good woman,” exclaimed
the Major as soon as he could find an opening in
her speech; “I have received the shirts, and am
very well satisfied with them! They do you credit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I am glad to hear it. I thought the child
wouldn’t disobey me, for she is always so correct!
Here she comes in now! Ah, Mary,” said Mrs.
Phelps with a good natured smile, “you like to have
had a scolding. So you took Major Pierpoint’s
linens home safe?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, aunt,” answered Mary, blushing and stammering
at seeing Major Pierpoint in the shop, while
the Major himself, taken by surprise at her sudden
appearance, colored like a school-boy; and scarce
conscious of what he did, respectfully lifted his hat,
as with downcast eyes she tripped past him to the
rear of the shop. She had let her bonnet fall carelessly
back from her head as she entered the shop,
and the bright light of the gas-burners flashing upon
her forehead, revealed more clearly the radiant
beauty of her complexion, and the exquisite loveliness
of her features. Her hair, which was the richest
shade of dark brown, was parted upon her smooth
forehead and lay on either cheek, after the fashion
of young maidens of her age; behind, it was gathered
by her tasteful fingers into a neat braid, the number
of whose silken folds showed the opulence and
great length of this glorious ornament of woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She bent her head and blushed between pleasure
and shame at this distinguished notice from Major
Pierpoint, while Mrs. Phelps looked from one to the
other, with a face on which wonder, curiosity and
suspicion were as plainly written as they ever were
on the face of woman. Leslie saw instantly the
position in which he had placed himself, and with
great presence of mind said, as if to excuse himself,
while he pursued at the same time the main object
he had in view—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is, I am told, an orphan, Mrs. Phelps. I feel
deep sympathy for orphans, particularly for young
unprotected females.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Phelps’ face immediately parted with its
combined expression, which was replaced by that
peculiar one which talkative women always put on
when they have an opportunity of indulging their
propensity. “Ah, yes,” she sighed, “ah, dear yes,
Major Pierpoint, she is indeed an orphan. She is a
good child, and has a face that will be either the
making or the breaking of her. I feel towards her
just as if she was my own flesh and blood; though,
between you and I, Major, I am neither kith nor kin
to her or hers, though I lets her call me aunt for
affection-like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who were her parents?” asked Major Pierpoint,
becoming deeply interested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, me, it is a sad story! I never tell it but it
makes me cry like a child;” and here Mrs. Phelps,
in anticipation, applied the corner of her apron to her
dry eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be so kind as to relate it, madam, if you please.
I shall listen to it with great interest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you must know when I was younger than
I am now, and before dear Fritz, my husband, died,
we were living in Boston, in quite respectable society,
Fritz keeping a thriving store, and I living a lady, as
it were, at home. But times is changed since then;
ah, me! Major Pierpoint. Well, don’t you think, as
I was waiting tea one winter’s night for Fritz, the
bell rung, and, instead of my husband, a man left a
basket of champaigne, as he said, telling the girl it
was a present for our wedding day, which was to be
on Saturday of the next week, sure enough, Major;
we having then been married seven years. Well, I
told her to set the champaigne basket down in the tea
room, and soon afterwards Fritz came in. He was
delighted when I showed him the present, and we
both puzzled our heads to guess what friend it came
from; but we sat down to the table intending to open
it after we had finished tea. Mr. Phelps was taking
his second cup when we both thought we heard a
child cry right in the room. We started, and both
asked ‘what is that?’ ‘It must be the cat,’ said
Fritz, and so we sat down again. We had not taken
two bites of toast before we were startled by the loud
shrill scream of an infant. ‘The champaigne basket,’
exclaimed Fritz: ‘it is in the champaigne basket,’ I
cried. ‘It is a baby in the champaigne basket,’
yelled the girl, letting fall the tea-kettle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fritz sprung to the basket and cut the cord with
the table-knife, and sure enough, Major Pierpoint,
there lay in the bottom the beautifullest little female
baby eyes ever looked upon—the very same Mary
Lee you just now took off your hat to! Well, to cut
the story short, Fritz and I concluded, after making
all inquiries, and advertising it in vain, to adopt it,
seeing as how Providence had never blessed us with
any children, neither before nor since. So we took
the dear infant as our own, and to this day I have
been as its own mother to it, and she has been as an
own child to me. Ah me! the cruel parents that could
desert such a sweet cherub. I have never been sorry
to this hour we took the dear child. Oh, she has been
a blessing to me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She would be a blessing to any body,” said the
Major warmly, his heart overrunning with emotion at
her narration; and his eyes unconsciously wandered
to the rear of the shop, where Mary sat quietly sewing.
He sighed, and then turning to Mrs. Phelps,
thanked her for her trouble in narrating Mary’s story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not the least, Major, not the least! I could tell
it fifty times a day if I had such a listener as
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may send me half a dozen pairs of gloves,
handkerchiefs, and—and—” Leslie hesitated, and
then hastily added, “any thing else in your shop you
think I would like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you are such a good customer, Major Pierpoint,”
said the pleased landlady; “I have just got
in some new style India cravats which I think will
suit you. Shall I send them to-night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, to-morrow at twelve.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you leave town to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, true—true, I had forgotten. But never mind,
madam, send them up, I think I shall be at home—yes,
I am sure, quite sure I shall be at home! I have
postponed my departure till the next day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will certainly send them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Major lingered an instant over the glass case,
and then buttoning up his overcoat, prepared to go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good evening, Mrs. Phelps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good evening, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will be sure and send them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shall not be disappointed, Major.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Major Pierpoint took three decided steps towards
the door and then turned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twelve o’clock, Mrs. Phelps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes sir, they shall be there precisely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Major still did not move. There was evidently
something he wished to say more, but was at a loss
how to say it. All at once he turned back to the
counter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By-the-bye, Mrs. Phelps, you may, if you please,
let the same young person bring them that took the
linens. That old woman, the last time she came,
like to have broke her neck by catching her foot in
the brass stair band. Besides, she is deaf as a post.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will send Mary, then,” said Mrs. Phelps, smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are very obliging, my dear madam. Good
evening.” And Major Pierpoint walked out of the
shop with a free, light step, and a bland smile illumining
his handsome features.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Phelps followed him with her eyes, and then
put on a very thoughtful look, and for a few moments
seemed to be communing with her own mind. Suddenly
she laid one fore-finger down upon the other
with emphasis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, ’tis clear as that gas-light! I can see as
deep as some folks can. He is not above forty, rich,
respectable, and kind and pleasant-hearted as a child,
and Mary’s beauty has evidently made an impression
upon him. He is a bachelor, and old bachelors often
fall in love with young girls! I do believe, now I
think it all over, he is in love with her. But then,
he is so rich and respectable! But Mary isn’t my
daughter; how does he or any body know but she is
respectable as he is himself? Plainly, there is something
at the bottom of all this. Major Pierpoint is
too honorable and moral for me to apprehend any
evil coming out of it. Mary shall go up to-morrow,
looking her best. Who knows what may happen?
The poor child is not mine, but then I wish her to do
as well as she can. I wonder what he said to her
this evening. Mary, dear, come here child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary came forward with a half finished linen collar
in her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, dear, what did Miss Clayton say to the
handkerchiefs you took to her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She said they were very neatly done, but that the
price was too high—and told me she could not pay
the bill unless you took off the ‘nineteen cents!’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How close some people are, especially rich old
maids that have once been beauties! They have no
children or husband to pick or peck at, and so they
must pick and peck on those that have to do work for
um. She don’t care about the nineteen cents—its
only to have something to find fault with. To-morrow,
at half past eleven, you call there for the seventeen
dollars, and let her have the nineteen cents, if it
will do her temper any good. Did Major Pierpoint
appear displeased because I didn’t get the shirts there
by six o’clock?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary blushed, she knew not why, at this common-place
question, and looking up and seeing her ‘aunt’s’
eyes fixed inquiringly upon her face, she became too
confused to speak in reply—and, after one or two
attempts to answer, dropped her head over the collar
in her hand, as if sewing it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the matter with the child? What did
Major Pierpoint say to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, m’m, here is the check he gave me.” Mrs.
Phelps glanced at it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all right! Prompt pay—no nineteen cents
to be cut off. But didn’t he say any thing to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary appeared still more confused. Her adopted
mother looked at her steadily though without displeasure
for a few seconds, then shook her head affirmatively,
with a slight smile of self-satisfaction.
“Humph,” she said to herself, “I see how it is! It
has gone further than I thought. He came here to-night
for nothing else in the world! Well, Mary,
to-morrow, at twelve precisely, you must be at Major
Pierpoint’s with them gloves, and handkerchiefs, and
silk stockings. You must start at half past eleven,
so as to call on the way on Miss Clayton for the
money for her bill. Why do you blush so—are you
afraid of Miss Clayton?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, aunt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you afraid of Major Pierpoint?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, aunt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, child, go to your sewing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary bounded away lightly, and Mrs. Phelps
looked after her with a prideful glance; “yes, if
she is not foolish she has her fortune made. I will
say nothing to her of my suspicions, but let her have
her own way. To talk to young girls on such a subject
and try to guide and advise them, only makes
puppets of them, and destroys the natural character.
Leave Mary to her own native good sense and unbiassed
feelings and she will be more likely to please
such a man as Major Pierpoint than if she practised
the most consummate artifices.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With these sensible reflections, Mrs. Phelps dropped
the subject for that night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At a few minutes before half past eleven, Mary
Lee made her appearance in the shop from her little
chamber over it, arrayed in a neat black silk dress,
with a pretty straw cottage, trimmed with delicate
blue ribbon, and her beautiful brown hair arranged
with elegant simplicity. It had not been ten minutes
since she left the shop to make this change in her
appearance. Yet it was as complete as if five hours
had been wasted before her little mirror. Can any
female reader tell me <span class='it'>why</span> Mary paid such attention
to her appearance? Mrs. Phelps on seeing her,
lifted up both hands, and an exclamation of surprise
and displeasure was on the tip of her tongue! But
some sudden reflection checked it on the verge of
utterance, and dropping her hands, she said quietly
and as if not noticing it—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So, Mary, you are ready. Take the bundle and
stop on the way at Miss Clayton’s. Be sure you
are at Major Pierpoint’s when the clock strikes
twelve.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, aunt,” said Mary, hastening from the shop
on her two-fold errand. As she passed up Chesnut
street with her little bundle, the sparkling beauty of
her face, her buoyant step and graceful motion, drew
after her many admiring eyes. It so chanced that
Leslie was returning from the Exchange reading-room,
whither he walked every morning, and was
standing on the corner of Sixth and Chesnut, conversing
with several bachelor gentlemen, when Mary
passed. She looked up, and seeing him, coloured and
dropped her head. Leslie did the same.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A lovely creature,” said one of the gentlemen;
“I seldom have seen a sweeter face or figure. You
know her, Major, by your mutual blushes,” added he,
smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I, gentlemen? oh, no,” said the Major, confused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is certainly extremely beautiful. See how
free and light her step is!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some pretty milliner, I dare say,” said the
Major, laughing. “Good morning, gentlemen;” and
Leslie took his way home more than ever enchanted,
deeper than ever in love! The quick, bright, eloquent,
yet unintended glance he had received from
her as she passed, kindled an imperishable flame in
his bosom. He hastened homeward with anticipations
of the delightful visit he was to receive at
twelve o’clock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Was Leslie Pierpoint really in love? did he resolve
to pay his addresses to this beautiful girl? did
he intend to ask her hand in marriage? did she fill
the place in his heart which Clara Clayton had left
void?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary soon reached Miss Clayton’s door in the
upper part of Chesnut street, near Ninth. It was
one of the most imposing mansions in the street.
Miss Clayton lived there with her old father—the
two alone! For several years after freeing herself
from Leslie, she lived in hopes of marriage, but in
vain. The men were afraid of her. Her mortification
when she found Leslie restored to perfect health,
knew no bounds. She had a secret hope that he
would yet re-address her; but from that period she
never received more than a cold and civil bow from
him. She could have poisoned herself with vexation.
But as years passed away, and she saw that he still
remained unmarried, she consoled herself with the
idea that she was the cause—and that he could
never love any one as he had loved her. This devoted
bachelorism was Clara’s only and greatest
consolation. It was a healing balm to her wounded
spirit. So he married not, she felt she could forgive
herself for her folly in not marrying him. It is true,
she watched his course to forty with some anxiety,
lest he might yet marry; but when he had passed
that climax, she gave herself no farther uneasiness,
and rested in the conscious assurance of his eternal
celibacy. This idea was the rainbow that spanned
her darkened skies—the sweet in her bitter cup of
life. But, alas! she was soon to see the rainbow
disappear, and her horizon become dark with storms!
Alas! she was to drink the remainder of the cup
with additional bitterness mingled with its dregs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was seated in her usual sitting room when
Mary arrived. Her hair was drawn back above her
ears and tied untidily with a dirty yellow ribbon;
she wore a loose wrapper, and her stocking feet
were thrust into red slippers. Her fingers were
loaded with rings, and ear drops hung from her ears.
Her complexion was something coarser for the wear
and tear of time, and had very plain traces of being
now indebted to white paint and rouge, for whatever
pretensions it claimed. Her forehead was crossed
by horizontal impatient wrinkles, and a deep frown
was cut between her eyebrows. She was thin about
the breast and shoulders, and very slender in the
waist, more so than in her youthful prime. The
general expression of her face was querulous and
sour—precisely such an expression as she might
have been expected to wear. As Mary was shown
in she looked up with a sharp, impatient gesture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So, Miss, you have come for the amount of your
bill!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, m’m, if you please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t <span class='it'>mem</span> me as if I was fifty, Miss.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, m’m.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did I not forbid your saying <span class='it'>marm</span> to me—what
is the amount of the bill?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have it, m’—— I mean Miss.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is better. Ah, yes, here it is, $17 19,
What did your mistress say about the 19 cents?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That she would take it off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well; here is seventeen dollars. Receipt
it.” Mary took a pen from an inkstand on the table
and acknowledged the payment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Humph, you write too pretty a hand for an
apprentice girl,” said Miss Clayton, glancing contemptuously
at Mary’s beautiful chirography. “I
dare say you can dance too?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Miss,” said Mary slightly smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And sing and play,” more contemptuously still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Miss.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Humph. Read Byron, Moore, Scott, doubtless,
and perhaps the French poets?” she continued with
a contemptuous smile of incredulity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Miss.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Miss. I suppose if I should ask you if
you read French and sung Italian, you would reply
with your parrot phrase, ‘yes, Miss.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Miss.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Upon my word! Ha, ha, ha! here’s a linen-draper’s
apprentice for you! I suppose you look to
marry some nobleman at the least, with all them
accomplishments, if you can! What package is
that beneath your arm, my pretty minx,” for Miss
Clayton had conceived a sudden and unaccountable
(save that her youth and beauty were the cause,)
dislike for Mary. And without waiting for a reply
she snatched it from her.</p>

</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>“You are sent with this to Major Pierpoint’s, are
you?” she asked sharply and with a suspicious look
at the young and guileless girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes m’m,” answered Mary quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Clayton let her eyes rest on the superscription
for a few moments, and then lifted them steadily
to the face of the maiden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You had best return directly to your shop with
the amount of your mistress’ bill, lest you lose it on
the way. I will dispatch my footman with this
package to his lodgings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thank you, but I am ordered to take it there
myself,” said Mary firmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed; but it would not be prudent for so young
a person as you to go to a bachelor’s rooms alone. I
will send it for you. Do you know Major Pierpoint?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, m’m,” answered Mary with embarrassment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you never seen him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was in the shop last evening,” answered Mary
evasively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he speak to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you please I will take the package and go,”
said Mary, half angry at this singular inquisition
upon her affairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take it, trollop,” said Miss Clayton, flinging it
towards her, “and tell your mistress when she has
occasion to send any one to me again, she will
oblige me by sending some civil person.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary stared with surprise, at a loss to account for
the lady’s humor, and gladly took her departure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The heavy tocsin of the State House had struck
the last stroke of twelve, as Mary timidly pulled the
bell at Major Pierpoint’s handsome residence. It
was opened by Cato.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Massa says de young woman will please walk
up and wait,” said Cato, as Mary offered to leave
the bundle in his hand. Mary hesitated an instant,
and then, trembling, (she could not tell why,) she
followed him to the library. The door was opened,
and Cato ushered her in with one of his best bows.
Leslie pretended to be very busily engaged in a book
as she entered, though he had been walking his room,
or watching through the blinds with ill-concealed
impatience till he heard the street door bell. He
permitted Cato to leave the room, and Mary to advance
half way to the table, before he gave signs of
her presence. He then suddenly rose up and turned
round.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, Miss Lee,” he said, with tender respect,
“you have brought the gloves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir,” said Mary, without lifting her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit down, if you please, while I examine the
package.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary quietly took a seat, and Major Pierpoint
began to look over the parcels. But evidently his
thoughts were not with this pursuit. His fingers
trembled—he shockingly rent several pairs of
gloves; put six of the handkerchiefs, one after another,
into his pocket; blew his nose on a pair of
silk hose, and at length sprung from the table in the
most admirable confusion of mind in which a bachelor,
at such a moment, could well be. After thrice
striding the room to gather courage, he approached
the surprised, embarrassed, yet not <span class='it'>unexpecting</span>
Mary. No woman of any sense, or feeling, or mind,
could be blind at such a time. He approached and
seated himself beside her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Lee——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mary trembled and remained silent. The Major
gazed upon her tell-tale face, and then furtively sought
her hand. She withdrew it instinctively, and half
rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, my dear Miss Lee! pardon me! I meant
no injury to your delicacy. Pray be seated!” and
he took her hand and gently drew her to the chair
which she had left. “I beg you to listen to me one
moment. I have conceived for you a deep and respectful
passion. Your beauty, grace and intelligence
have made an impression upon my heart no time can
ever efface. It is true you are young and full of life
and beauty—I have passed half the allotted life of
man. But the disparity is in years only. My heart
is as young as your own, my feelings as buoyant, my
hopes as bright. I have sought to meet you to-day
to make a confession of the sentiments with which
you have inspired me, to tell you how intimately my
happiness is involved in your existence, to throw
myself upon your generosity. You are an orphan,
alas! and a cold, unpitying world is before you!
Your loveliness and helplessness claim protection.
Permit me to fill that delightful position near you
while life lasts. I offer you my heart, my hand, my
fortune, and promise to devote my life to the promotion
of your happiness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Major, after ending his eloquent appeal, gazed
upon her downcast face several moments in silence.
She made no reply! He still continued to hold her
hand. Slowly he lifted it to his lips. There was no
resistance. He again sought her eyes. Tears were
silently gushing from them, and rolling in sparkling
globules down her lovely cheeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good God, Miss Lee, have I offended you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir,” said Mary, lifting her eyes, the lashes
dewy with tears, and sweetly smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why these tears, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not know, indeed, unless it be that they
flow from gratitude,” she answered, looking into his
face with a radiant smile, like sunshine in an April
shower.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Major’s eyes filled also, and the next moment
he pressed the happy girl to his heart.</p>

<hr class='tbk107'/>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, Mary Lee became Major Leslie’s wife through
<span class='it'>gratitude</span>. They were married, for he well knew
gratitude would grow to love, and a brief time proved
that he judged rightly. One month from the day on
which he confessed his passion he led to the altar
his charming bride. They were married publicly in
church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, Major, so you—don’t know her—some milliner’s
apprentice, eh?” laughingly said a gentleman
present, after the ceremony was over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clara Clayton, hearing that Leslie Pierpoint was
to be married, went to the church, disguised in a
strange bonnet and long green veil—but Leslie recognised
her by her taper waist, and felt that his
triumph and (if such a feeling really existed in his
breast) his revenge were complete. Yes, Clara Clayton
witnessed the ceremony, and when she saw it
and recognised the bride’s face as she turned from
the altar, she could scarcely suppress a shriek of
mingled anger and disappointed malice. She went
home and died the same year, the victim of her own
selfishness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leslie Pierpoint and his beautiful lady are now
travelling in Europe. Mary makes him an excellent
wife, proving to be as good as she is beautiful.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>When</span> I was in the dragoons, we were quartered,
for a while, not far from Rowseville, and it was my
lot to receive a general invitation to the dinners of
the club. A jollier set of fellows never drew cork or
emptied a decanter—heaven be merciful to them for
their sins! They always had the best a-going;
could tell north from south side Madeira,—and
tossed off their bumpers, hour in and hour out, as
easily as an old spinster drinks her tea. As for their
president, Captain Humphreys, he was a paragon of
a good fellow. Short, square, deep chested, and
muscular as Hercules, he was just the man to keep a
set of such spirits in order; and, I verily believe, if
any of the youngsters had ventured to dispute his
will, he would have tossed them over the marquee as
easily as I could hurl a racket ball. He had spent
most of his life at sea, having seen service in every
latitude. He could tell a good story, and danced a
jig to perfection. He was, moreover, something of a
<span class='it'>gourmand</span>; always presided over our culinary rites;
and made the best chowder of any man in the States,
or, for that matter, as the old cook said, “in the
’varsal world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is nothing like fishing, and a table on the
green sward, to give one an appetite; and it would
have done your heart good to have seen us on the day
I first dined with the club—but especially to have
beheld Humphrey’s jovial face, when he announced
the opening toast. And then such a time as followed.
Sherry, Port, Madeira, Jamaica and Cogniac!—why
they chased each other from the table faster than the
witches did old Tam O’Shanter, in the road by Ayr.
Some of the youngsters soon began to grow noisy;
and even one or two of their seniors winked a good
deal unnecessarily; but Humphreys, and a set of the
older stagers at the head of the table, kept it up,
without drawing a rein, until I began to think they
could fag down even Bacchus himself. And all this
time their jests would have made a hermit die
with laughter! Yet Humphreys never suffered his
youngsters to indulge beyond a certain point, and he
had a story to account for this circumspection which
made my ribs sore for a week after hearing it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Silence, you addle-heads,” he thundered, as soon
as he saw they were getting beyond their depths—“can’t
one of you sing at a time, without keeping up
such an infernal clatter of Dutch, French, English and
Congo songs? You remind me of a set of chaps I
had the honor to dine with in Boston—no, not the
honor, for they all drank to excess—and a man in
that state” (and here the worthy speaker, by way
of corollary, tossed off a bumper) “is a shock to my
moral feelings. Keep in soundings if you can’t sail
safely out of them; but, for heaven’s sake, don’t disgrace
our table with a set of indecent inebriates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, to come back to my story—you must know
that the Governor’s Guards, in Boston, are a gay set
of youngsters, and, at their annual dinner at the State
House, they make the corks fly as I’ve seen only
grape shot showering from a battery. Well—no disrespect
to the cloth—their dinner is always opened
and closed by a parson; and a good rule it is; for
when the governor sees that his youngsters are getting
heady, he has but to give a nod—the benediction
is pronounced, and they are forced to break up.
When I was there, however, his excellency postponed
the dismissal rather too long, so that when he gave
the signal to the parson, there wasn’t a chap, at the
lower end of the table, who could carry his wine
to his mouth without spilling half of the liquid. A
blessed sight it was to see them then—as proper a
set of youngsters, in general, as you’d wish to look
upon—shouting, laughing, singing, standing in
chairs, waving their glasses on high, and altogether
cutting a figure not the most pleasant for a moral
man like me to behold. They saw the parson get up
and they heard him begin to speak, but they were too
far gone to distinguish either his person or his words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Hilloo, Bill,’ said one to his neighbor, ‘is that
a new toast? What does he say?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Can’t—make—it out,’ hiccuped Bill, with
drunken gravity, ‘but I guess—it’s—it’s—something
con—found—ed fine. Let’s give the old cock three
cheers,’ and the whole set sprang to their feet and
huzzaed ’til the very roof above us seemed to tremble
with the din. The poor parson hesitated, stopped,
and looked in bewilderment at his excellency—who
could only keep himself from laughing, so inexpressibly
ludicrous was the whole scene, by hanging his
head down and cramming his handkerchief into his
mouth. As for the rest of us, there was no resisting
it—we laid back in our chairs and laughed until
the tears ran out of our eyes,—while the ladies in
the gallery, the dear creatures, almost burst their
boddice strings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His excellency explained all to the parson the
next day, and made a thousand apologies—but the
good man never could be got again to ask a benediction
over the Governor’s Guards.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you tell that for the morals of your
table, eh!” said one of the party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly,” answered the president, laughing, “and
I never saw one yet whom it didn’t cure of excess at
table, except a fellow who used to say it was hereditary
in him, by the mother’s side, to have the cholic,
and that brandy was the only cure. That chap was
a character: I’ve a story I’ll tell you about him some
of these days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not now?” asked a dozen in a breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I suppose if I must I must,—but first pass
us the bottle, and let us drink to his memory—he
died, poor fellow, in Florida, where many a brave
man has laid his bones. Here’s to Tim O’Donnell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A silence of a few moments having elapsed, during
which all eyes were turned on the president, that personage,
after hemming twice, thus began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never was a handsomer fellow than Tim O’Donnell,
lieutenant in the ——. Tall, well shaped, with
the eye of a young eagle, and a pair of jet black
whiskers, that were worth, to a fortune-hunter, fifty
thousand dollars, Tim was the perfect picture of a
soldier—and, to use his own phrase, ‘a divil of a
chap among the girls.’ He made more conquests in
a week than I would in a year; and, as you may see,”
and here he stroked his chin complacently, “there
are few fellows as good looking as I am. But Tim
was after money, and used to flirt with the dear creatures
only to keep his hand in for an heiress, when
one should present. At length he was introduced to
a lovely creature at a ball,—blue eyes, auburn hair,
the shape of a goddess, and lips that would make
your mouth water, even if you were as dry as old
mahogany—and, for a while, he scarcely knew
whether he was standing on his head or on his feet.
He even paid court, so much was he smitten, to a
long, scraggy, hatchet-shouldered spinster of an aunt,
who attended his charmer as a sort of <span class='it'>chaperon</span>. The
next day he was somewhat cooled down—at least he
determined to check his raptures until he inquired
after the fortunes of Miss Wheeler, for so his charmer
was called. He left me for this purpose about noon,
and in an hour rushed into my room perfectly insane
with joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Och—give me your hand—shower the blessings
on my head,’ he exclaimed, dancing round the room,
‘sure and I’m in heaven the day—ouch, ullabaloo,
was there iver such luck?—ten thousand acres, the
dear sowl, and a rint roll as long as a rigiment’s line:
I’m a made man—hurrah!’ and throwing his cap up
he caught it again, and then capered around the room,
even carrying his antics so far as to leap over sundry
chairs. I was nearly dying with laughter—and as
yet I was totally ignorant of the cause of this joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘What do you mean?’ said I, ‘you haven’t told
me what all this congratulation is to be about.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never did I see a fellow look more astonished
than Tim. He stopped still, stared at me incredulously,
and then gave vent to his wonder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Blood and ages, and is the man drunk? Don’t
ye know it’s all about Miss Araminta Wheeler, and
the immense fortune she’s to bring me? The only
living child—all the rest dead of scarlet fever, praise
to the saints! and her owld father expected to kick
the bucket everyday. Ouch, ullaloo-o-o, ain’t I the
happy man? It’s marry the girl I will, this blessed
week.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘But will the ‘owld father’ consent—eh!
Tim?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Divil a bit do I care whether he consents or not,
if the daughter says ‘yes’—oh! such a jewel of a
woman,—and what an iligant pattern the young
O’Donnells will be!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Suppose the father guards her too well to permit
an elopement? That dragon of an aunt looks as if
she was kept to play the duenna.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Arrah, my lad,’ said Tim, with a knowing wink,
‘I’ll soon fix that, or my name isn’t Timothy O’Donnell,
of Ballywhangle, of the county of Clare, standing
six feet two in my stockings. Can’t I pretend to
make love to the owld hag when the niece isn’t
by? Oh! trust me for <span class='it'>brushing the dew</span> into her
eyes.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I saw no more of Tim for nearly a week, except
occasional glimpses caught of him at balls and concerts,
where he was in attendance on his charmer
and a spectral looking spinster, whom I recognised
as the aunt. As I wanted to give him a fair field—keep
the bottle lively—I did not approach them;
so I had no opportunity of judging his success, until
one morning he burst into my room vociferating that
he had got a note from his charmer, in answer to one
he had sent the day before, in which she consented to
elope with him that very night. He called on me to
ask me to get a post-chaise; for, in order to avoid the
publication of banns, they would have to be united in
another state. Tim was in such raptures that he
couldn’t attend to any matter-o’-fact business, so I
promised all he asked, and he left me, singing as he
went, ‘Come, haste to the wedding,’ and cutting all
sorts of extravagant antics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Midnight was the hour fixed on for the <span class='it'>affaire</span>,
and, punctual to the minute, Tim’s post-chaise drew
up a few rods from his charmer’s door, while the
gallant lieutenant himself, springing out, made all
haste to the rendezvous. The night was black as
pitch—you could have cut the darkness out in
slices—and a wild wind blew over the fields, roaring
away down in the woods, like a gale in the rigging of
a line-of-battle ship. Tim could scarcely pick his
way along through the garden, but at length, after
sundry tacks, he gained the front of the house,—yet
not a sign of a living being could he see. He began
to fear that his charmer’s heart had failed her, but at
that instant he perceived a dark moving object just
ahead of him, and hurrying forward, he soon recognised
his future bride, muffled and cloaked for the
journey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Shure, and ye’re as welcome as the birds in
spring,’ said Tim, catching her in his arms, ‘and it’s
mighty proud I am to see ye, my darlin.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The trembling bride clung closer to Tim as he
spoke, and murmured something in reply, but what
it was, the whistle of the wind prevented him from
hearing distinctly. Tim knew there was no time
to lose, however, so, without waiting for a repetition
of the words, he bore his prize off, and never
stopped till he had placed her in the chaise, stowed
her maid opposite, and was himself seated by her
side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘And now,’ said he, as the post-boy put up the
steps, ‘don’t spare the horse-flesh—do ye hear, ye
blackguard?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The boy nodded, and, the next instant, they were
thrashing along as fast as four posters could carry
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If Tim had been in raptures before, he was now
fairly mad with his success. Up to the last moment,
he had been tormented with a fear lest something
should occur by which this rich prize should slip
through his fingers; but now his charmer was actually
beside him, and they were being whirled over the
ground at a rate which would soon defy pursuit.
‘Was ever fellow in such good luck?’ thought Tim.
Thousands of acres, an only daughter, and she as
clean in her run as a Baltimore clipper. How he
cursed the presence of the maid, which prevented
him from being as tender as he thought the occasion
demanded. However, he could take his charmer’s
hand, without shocking her modesty, and he went
through pretty quick, all the variations of which
squeezing is liable. He would have stolen his arm
around the bride’s waist, but the envious cloak prevented
this. Tim could scarcely endure the probation.
On they rattled, all this while, with the tempest
roaring at their heels, and, as the night without
grew stormier, the agitation of the bride increased,
she almost sobbed, and clung closer and closer every
minute to Tim. It made his heart, as he said, ‘leap
into his mouth intirely,’ to feel her arms around his
neck in the extremity of her fright.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Whist, darlin,’ he said, ‘don’t be alarmed—it’s
only a little bit of a storm, to keep our bloody pursuers
from hearing us. Before mornin we’ll be in
York, and then the praist will make you my own.
Speak, and tell me, ye’re not frightened? Shure,
and ain’t I by your side, mavourneen?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The answer of the bride was delivered in such a
low and tremulous voice, and interrupted by so many
sobbings, that Tim, though he listened his best,
couldn’t for the life of him make out more than a
word here and there. However, he thought he distinguished
enough to fill him with more rapture than
ever, and, forgetting all about the maid, he drew his
bride still closer to his bosom, and, nestling her head
on his shoulder, poured forth his vows in torrents of
eloquence. The Lord only knows what he said—Irishmen
are proverbial for hyperbole.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘And is it that I wont love ye intirely, my princess?’
said Tim, by way of a grand wind up. ‘Shure,
and I’ll worship ye as the heathens do the sun, and
so will my five brothers, and the tenantry on my estate—though
it’s more than I know,’ muttered Tim
to himself, ‘where to find them—and won’t I be
proud to shew ye off to my friends as the handsomest
and sweetest woman in the rigiment? There, now,
be aisy, my jewel—your father won’t catch us. Oh!
isn’t it iligantly I’ve outwitted him, and that owld
hag of an aunt, your namesake?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Old hag of an aunt,’ screamed the bride, starting
back from Tim’s shoulder as if an adder had stung
her, ‘why—who—do you take <span class='it'>me</span> for?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘For Miss Araminta Wheeler, and divil a one
else—shure, and I have not offended ye, my darlin,
by that same thrifle of a remark?’ and he drew his
bride again toward him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Murder—off—help—oh! you vile, deceiving,
wicked monster,’ shrieked the bride, pushing away
Tim with both her hands, ‘you’ve ruined me forever.
And to call me a hag—oh! oh!’ and she went off
almost into hysterics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Blood and ages—who have we here indeed?’
thundered Tim, all at once recognizing the now shrill
tones of his companion, and kicking open the coach
door, he saw, for the first time, by the faint light of
the chaise-lamps, the face of the speaker, ‘it’s the
aunt herself—the owld serpent take her! A pretty
mess I’m in, running off with ye, ye apology for a
skeleton, instead of with the niece. Pray, madam,’
and he bowed sarcastically, ‘was it ye I honored with
my proposal?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Didn’t you send me a note—a—asking me to
elope?’ hysterically sobbed the aunt. ‘Oh! you vile
wretch.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Ou—u—h! I see it all,’ whistled Tim. ‘The
dumb baste of a messenger gave it to ye instead of to
the other.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You said before, too,’ sobbed the aunt, ‘that you
a—a—dored me.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘The Lord forgive my sins,’ muttered Tim betwixt
his teeth. ‘But may-be,’ he said coaxingly, as
a new thought struck him, ‘ye’re the heiress after
all.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tim got no answer but a new burst of hysteric
tears, mingled with ejaculations, among which he
could distinguish a whole dictionary of reproaches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I’m thinking,’ said Tim, after awhile, ‘ye’d
better be getting home as soon as convanient. This
is a bit of a mistake,’ and then, in an under tone he
groaned, ‘oh! but it’s ruined I am with the chaise
hire intirely.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The horses’ heads were soon turned, and just as
morning dawned, the runaways drove up to the lane
leading to Mr. Wheeler’s residence, where the bride
expectant alighted, and Tim, cursing his blunder,
kept on to his quarters. What became of the aunt,
I never cared to inquire. As for Tim, he had sense
enough to know that the game was up for him in that
quarter. Though he strove to keep his elopement a
secret, the joke soon leaked out, and he was the banter
of the whole regiment. An order to repair to
Florida was hailed as a God-send, as it saved him
from the quizzing of his mess, which to this day has
for a standing toast, <span class='sc'>O’Donnell’s Prize</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many a burst of laughter interrupted the President
during the recital of this story, which loses half of its
effect when deprived of his inimitable mimicry of
the conversations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We adjourned, at a late hour, for the stars were
already twinkling in the sky when we turned our
horses’ heads homewards. The cool evening breeze,
and the exhilaration of a rapid pace, kept up the flow
of our spirits until we parted for the night—though
we did not separate until we had drunk a parting cup
at the house of that most hospitable of hosts, Deacon
Green.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next meeting of the club found me again
amongst them. But the incidents of the second dinner
must be reserved for another paper.</p>

<p class='line0'><span class='sc'>I wandered</span> out in summer time,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;One pleasant afternoon,</p>
<p class='line0'>Amid the green and cooling woods—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The leafy woods of June;</p>
<p class='line0'>As through its temple’s shadowy aisles</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;In mournfulness I walked,</p>
<p class='line0'>I listened to the breezy trees</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;As friend with friend they talked!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>And gazing upwards in my face,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Each meek wood-flower drew back,</p>
<p class='line0'>Nor did a single blade of grass</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Impede my onward track;</p>
<p class='line0'>And ever on my listening ear</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;There came a lulling sound,</p>
<p class='line0'>As of a multitude in prayer—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Methought ’twas holy ground!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>I rested on a mossy bank,</p>

<p class='line0'>The lithe green branches arch’d o’erhead,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And twined their arms in love;</p>
<p class='line0'>And nought was seen of the blue sky</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>A twilight, rich and tender light,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Came stealing from the skies,</p>
<p class='line0'>And, oh! ’twas like the light that rests</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;In a young mother’s eyes!</p>
<p class='line0'>I saw the gentle flowrets wave</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Their urns, still filled with dew,</p>
<p class='line0'>And by my side the dark-fringed fir—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The “tree of Heaven,” grew!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Oh! all was fair and beautiful,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;In these bright forest bowers,</p>
<p class='line0'>A region of perpetual green—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;A paradise of flowers!</p>
<p class='line0'>Though all was very beautiful,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;So free from woe and sin,</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;To darker worlds within:</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>I closed my eyes, and pressed my hand</p>

<div class='stanza-outer'>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;They passed in my review,</p>
<p class='line0'>And each faint shadow as it came,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Still pale and paler grew!</p>
<p class='line0'>On, onward yet, they came—a throng</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Of white and ghastly things,</p>

<p class='line0'>Oh! many light and careless words</p>

<p class='line0'>And thoughtless things I said or did—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;All seemed embodied there!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>And mingling with accusing sins,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Faint-shadowed forms swept by,</p>

<p class='line0'>At length a sweet, reproachful face</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Looked in upon my dream,</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Whoever</span> has once stood upon the summit of
Mount Holyoke, will never forget the rich scene
spread out before him. For miles—as far as the
eye can reach on every side—may be seen Nature
in her most imposing forms. Vales clad in their rich
vesture of green, watered by the limpid streams,
cool, pure, and refreshing; gently sloping hills,
crowned with fields of waving grain, and spotted
here and there with the fleecy herds; and yet farther
on, rising peak upon peak, and summit upon summit,
the “huge pillars” which “prop the heavens” rear
their craggy heads on high, bidding defiance to storm
and tempest, and scarcely trembling even at the peals
of “living thunder” which “leap” from crag to
crag. Occasionally, peering above the tall trees that
surround them, the spires of numerous churches
point out the villages, and form agreeable pictures
on which the delighted eye may rest. Sweeping the
very base of Holyoke the broad Connecticut rolls its
calm tide along, and winding away into the distance
far to the south, may be traced on a clear day, circling
its way through the verdant meadows almost
to its very mouth. Directly across the river from
Holyoke, Mount Tom rises in sullen majesty, as if
disdaining to hold fellowship with the humble yet
beautiful objects around. Northampton—with its
snow-white dwellings, its spires and turrets, its hill—the
sides of which are occupied with delightful
mansions—and its top surmounted with a lovely
grove, forms a panorama, the beauty of which must
be seen to be realized. Between it and the river is a
broad valley, chequered with fields of various colors,
spotted with trees, and giving rich promise of the
harvest. Nearly at the foot of the mountain—a
little to the northward, rising not far above the surface
of the river—is a small and fertile island, of a
diamond form, like an emerald set in silver. This
island we will call Hockanum, a name given to it
years and years ago. Still further north, on a broad
peninsula formed by a bend of the river, stands the
town of Hadley, with the history of which is associated
many a thrilling tradition. One of these it
will be our object now to present to the reader.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The town of Hadley was settled in the year 1659,
by emigrants from the Colony of Connecticut, who
removed on account of differences in religious opinions.
The principal man of these emigrants was
Mr. John Webster, accompanied by the Rev. John
Russell, formerly minister of Wethersfield. Although
Whites and Indians were mingled in close contact
here, it is believed that there was no disturbance of
any kind until after the breaking out of King Philip’s
war in 1675. A perfectly amicable disposition was
manifested on either side, and danger and fear of the
aborigines were scarcely entertained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the southern extremity of the beautiful street
on which the town is principally built, close upon
the bank of the majestic Connecticut, or as it was
formerly, and perhaps more properly called, the
<span class='it'>Quonnecticut</span>, stood, at the period of our tale, the
residence of the Rev. John Russell—mentioned
above as one of the first settlers of the town. A few
rods lower down, and on the opposite side of the
street, lived Mr. Webster, his friend and companion
in emigration. William, the oldest son of Mr. Russell,
was a young man about twenty-three years of
age, of a bold and fearless disposition, with a heart
generally open and confiding. Yet there was enough
of cautiousness in his disposition, to render him capable
of keeping secret his designs, and of acting
silently yet effectually. He was finely formed, and
remarkably well gifted by nature. There was, indeed,
but one trait that marred the general harmony
of his natural constitution, and that was, at times, a
slight want of amiability, a haughtiness of spirit that
could not brook restraint or opposition. As it was,
he was the pride of his father’s family, and the
object of admiration to the blooming maidens round.
But there was one whom he esteemed far above all
others—the daughter of his father’s friend. Eliza
Webster was one of those beings whom one would
love without exactly knowing why. Not really
beautiful—indeed, rather ordinary looking than
otherwise—it was impossible for any sensible young
man to enjoy her society for any length of time,
without finding himself fast yielding to the impression
which he could not prevent her from making on
his heart. Always lively and cheerful, with a rich
fund of humor, and a shrewd and penetrating mind,
she determined to enjoy, and to make the most of life,
and to render all about her as happy as herself. She
was the simple and unaffected, the true child of
nature, and yet nature’s adorer. Never was she
happier than when rambling along the course of the
river on whose banks she had always lived, or climbing
the craggy heights which towered at a short distance
below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the little island of Hockanum lived an old man
who had formerly been a chief at Nonotuck, now
Northampton. His name was Shaomet. He subsisted
on the fish he drew from the clear waters, and
the deer and other game which he found in the fastnesses
of Holyoke. The solace of his declining years
was his daughter, Tahattawa, a sprightly lass of
eighteen summers. Her step was light as that of the
young fawn, and her merry laugh rang out upon the
clear air, and danced like music over the broad
bosom of the river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With this girl, Eliza Webster had formed an intimate
attachment. Often had Tahattawa paddled her
across in her light canoe to the little island on which
was her home. For hours had they sat under the
shade of its green trees, and laughed and conversed
together, instructing each other the while in many
of the little arts with which each was familiar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, Tahattawa had a lover—a young warrior
belonging to the fort which the whites had allowed
the natives to build within a few rods of the most
populous street of Nonotuck. Eliza had often met
him at the tent of Shaomet, and frequently accompanied
him and Tahattawa in his fishing excursions
down the river. The thought of danger to herself
never entered her mind; she reposed perfect confidence
in the integrity of her friends—even though
their skins were tawny; and the youth appeared to
be almost as fond of the society of his pale-faced
friend as he was of that of Tahattawa herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One fine morning in the month of May, 1676, a deer
was seen swimming swiftly down the Quonnecticut.
William Russell snatched his rifle, and, springing
into a light canoe, started in pursuit. At length, as
they neared the little island of Hockanum, the huntsman
had gained so far on his game that he was just
raising his gun to his shoulder to fire upon him, when
suddenly the deer sprang more than a foot clear of
the water—and the sharp crack of a rifle came
ringing on the ear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A canoe immediately shot out from a small cove
on the shore of the island, and a young Indian, paddling
up to the deer, seized him by the horns and
lifted him into the boat. By this time William had
come up. Whether the Indian had seen him in chase
of the deer before he fired or not, he certainly laid
claim to it as his own. The other was no less strenuous
in asserting his own right to the game; and,
drawing up his canoe along side of the Indian, was
about to place it in his own boat. The other also
seized it, and declared he would not surrender it but
with life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fiery spirit of young Russell now began to
chafe, and the flash of his eyes told plainly that he
would not tamely brook such a wrong. The blood
rose to his face, and his heart beat quick and violently
with anger. He stood for a moment hesitating
what course to pursue. Give up the deer he would
not—yet he shuddered at what might be the consequences
of an open rupture, at a time when Philip
was in arms, and the name of that mighty chieftain
was inspiring many of the Indians with courage, and
striking terror to the hearts of the whites.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wawhillowa—for it was he, the lover of Tahattawa—with
an air which seemed to challenge his antagonist
to its removal, placed his foot on the game,
and rising to his full height regarded the other with
a look of calm defiance. Not a muscle moved, but
his teeth were firmly clenched, and the heavy frown
that slowly settled on his brow, told of the storm that
was gathering within his breast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We know not what might have been the result of
this controversy—for there was equal resolution and
courage, and perhaps strength on both sides—had it
not been for a third person. At the instant that William
grasped his rifle, and the other his tomahawk,
Shaomet, the old man of the island, sprang between
them and called on both to desist from their useless
strife. He had watched the whole proceeding from
the door of his tent, and, fearful of a dispute, had
launched his canoe and approached them without
their perceiving him, so absorbed were both the
young men in the feelings of the moment. They
seemed at first somewhat angry at his interference;
but when Wawhillowa remembered that Shaomet was
the father of his intended bride; and William, that
he had often manifested his friendship for Eliza,
their resentment towards the old man instantly
began to cool.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their animosity towards each other, however, was
not at all diminished. They stood over the game
like two young lions; and each of them, perhaps,
exercising about as much reason. The old man quietly
proceeded to skin the deer, and to cut it into
equal parts. This was quickly done. He then tried
to induce them to accept each a part. It would have
been, perhaps, a difficult matter to decide which was
the rightful owner of the game—but each of the
two opponents was resolved to have it all or none—William
threw into the river the half which Shaomet
had placed in his canoe, while the young Indian
dropped his tomahawk and hastily paddled towards
the island. The old chief having secured the game
in his own boat, slowly followed him, and the
Englishman sullenly worked his way up the current,
muttering revenge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the morning of the 12th of June, 1676. Day
had hardly dawned. The bright star of morning had
not yet melted away; but the dark clouds that had
obscured the sky broke in pieces, and rolled away
in huge masses far into the distance, disclosing the
bright full moon—her radiance not yet dimmed by
the presence of the king of brightness. Under cover
of the night a powerful body of Indians had advanced
near to the town of Hadley, and at the southern extremity
of the street on which it was—and still is—principally
built, had proceeded to dispose among
the thick trees and underwood, a strong band of
faithful warriors as an ambuscade. There they lay,
still and motionless as the trees that concealed them.
There was many a stout heart beating eagerly for
the fray that would soon cease to beat for ever.
Many a strong arm firmly grasped the rifle or the
tomahawk, soon itself to be in the grasp of an all-powerful
foe. Many a fiery eye rolled round in its
socket which was soon to be covered with the film
of death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How calmly and soundly slept the inhabitants of
that village, even whilst the chafed savage was
prowling for his prey. All, unsuspecting, their
slumbers were deep and unbroken, while the hungry
lions about them were awaiting, impatiently, the
moment of attack. How often while we sleep are
our destinies decided for us! Wealth—fame—happiness—the
rewards of toil—the requiters of
virtue—good and evil—little circumstances and
great—are all hovering above and about us, while
we are unconscious of their presence. Life and
death may hang upon a single hair, while we cannot
raise a hand or bend a thought to avert or secure
either.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The eastern sky had just begun to be tinged with
red, and a few straggling rays of the sun, still far
below the horizon, were dancing in fairy shapes
towards the zenith, when the work of death and
of cruelty began. Stealthily and silently the savages
crept on. Yet let us not call them <span class='it'>savages</span>: they
were but redressing their wrongs—but avenging
the life blood of their race; and though blood was
that morning poured out like water; and though the
tomahawk and scalping knife were the instruments
of death, and the sleeping and the helpless were the
victims;—yet their destroyers were but doing with
their enemies as they did with each other: they
were not doing violence to their own natures: they
were even exercising far more <span class='it'>humanity</span> than those
who, with the Gospel of Peace in their hand, and
the light of civilization around them, had sapped
the very foundations of the Red Man’s race. Swiftly
the work went on. A stifled groan—a scream of
anguish occasionally broke the stillness of the hour.
Save that, all was wrapped in deep, dread, ominous
silence. At length, by accident, a rifle was discharged.
On that little circumstance hung the life
of hundreds. The sound echoes through the long
street—a window is raised—a door is opened—the
alarm is given—and armed men pour forth, and prepare
to resist the foe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All was confusion and dismay. Rifles were fired—loaded,
and discharged again. Tomahawks gleamed—swords
flashed—occasionally a small piece of
ordnance rolled its infant thunder over the plain, and
the smoke and din of the contest rose up together to
the heavens. Men ran hither and thither. Some
commanded, and none obeyed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly, “a man of venerable aspect” appeared
among the scattered and nearly discomfited inhabitants.
He collected them in a body, and, assuming
the command, arrayed them in the best manner for
defence. He seemed experienced and skilful in the
art of war. And now the tide was changed; the
Indians in their turn were routed and fled in confusion.
In vain the chiefs attempted to rally them. A
sudden panic seized the savages; and they, precipitately,
fled. After the danger was over, all eyes
were looking for the man who had so wonderfully
assisted them, but in vain—he had gone, none knew
whither. Many conjectures were formed as to who
the stranger could be; some supposed it was the
guardian angel of the town—but no; it was <span class='sc'>Goffe</span>,
<span class='it'>the Regicide</span>!</p>

<p class='pindent'>His seemingly miraculous appearance at that time
may be easily accounted for. Goffe and Whalley,
two of the Judges of Charles the First, were then
both secreted in the house of the Rev. Mr. Russell.
Seeing the inhabitants in danger, Goffe determined
to hazard his life for those who had so generously
afforded him refuge at the risk of their own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Amongst those of the Indians who had lain in ambush,
the most eager of all was Wawhillowa, the
young chief of Nonotuck. With a disposition naturally
fierce, his intercourse with the whites had done
little to soften it, or to influence him in their favor;
and since the dispute with William Russell, over the
carcass of the deer, he had been burning with indignation
and resentment. He had joined the expedition
against Hadley with his warriors, partly in the hope
of meeting Russell in the fray, and thus gratifying
his revenge; and partly because his spirit could not
bear to be inactive, whilst the name of Philip was
spreading terror through New England. Emulous of
the rising fame and fortunes of the Narragansett
King, he hoped, ere long, to raise for himself a name
among the tribes that should eclipse the reputation of
all before him. The English, he thought, were fit
objects on which to exercise his ambition; and, having
lately conceived a strong aversion to the whole
race, he had determined to embrace the present opportunity
of signalizing himself, and venting on his
enemies his hearty dislike.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ambuscade laid for the purpose of cutting off
the expected retreat of the English, of course, utterly
failed of its object; and when those who formed it
saw the ill success of their coadjutors, they began to
seek safety—each for himself as best he might.
Wawhillowa disdained to leave the field without
some trophy of his valor; and, while his associates
were fleeing in every direction, he was bent on executing
a plan which would at once satisfy his animosity,
and establish his celebrity among the warriors
of his tribe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just back of the house in which Mr. Webster
resided was a small eminence, from the top of which
could be obtained a fine view of the whole plain of
Hadley. The sides of this little hill were thickly
covered with bushes, through which a narrow foot
path led from the house to its summit. To this hill
had Eliza Webster repaired to witness the contest
that was raging on the plain. Wawhillowa having
cautiously approached the house, at length caught
the flutter of Eliza’s white garments through the
bushes, and hastily but silently approached her.
Suddenly she was grasped by a strong and unseen
hand, and her handkerchief being pressed into her
mouth effectually prevented her screaming. The
strength of the young chief was that of a giant, and
scarcely hindered by the slender form of the fair girl
he bore, he bounded like a tiger after his comrades.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swiftly they fled, nor paused till the sun was within
an hour or two of high noon. And still Wawhillowa
pressed on, bearing his fair charge, not left far behind
even by his unencumbered associates. When he
considered that there was no longer danger of pursuit,
he set the poor girl on her feet, and, removing
the handkerchief from her mouth, ordered her to
walk on before him. In vain she asked him why
he treated her thus—why he had torn her from her
friends and was bringing her to a cruel death—or to
a captivity worse than death. In vain she pleaded
her friendship with Tahattawa—her former intimacy
even with himself; he walked on in stern
silence, and now and then by an impatient gesture,
gave her to understand that he wished her to be as
taciturn as himself. With the eye of one accustomed
to the forest, the chief bent his course directly towards
the place of their encampment. Bushes and
thorns often obstructed their way; and although
Eliza was wearied and sadly torn by the briars, she
even dared to threaten her foe. Not aware of the
difficulty that existed between them, and which had
been the cause of her own seizure, she warned Wawhillowa
to beware of the vengeance of her lover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the mention of the name of his deadly foe, the
fiery savage sprang to the side of his victim and was
about to plunge his knife to her heart, but calming
the transport of his passion he spared her for a more
perfect revenge. His eye glared fiercely on her, and
triumph shone in every lineament of his features as
he replied,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hate him! I will have his blood; his scalp
shall hang up and dry in the smoke of Wawhillowa’s
wigwam. The fair Flower that loves him shall never
again see his face except it be in death. She shall
never be his wife; she shall be the Red Man’s slave—aye,
a captive to the Red Man’s bride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the mean time, all was consternation at the
house of Mr. Webster. No one had seen Eliza when
she left the house, and her absence could be accounted
for only by the supposition that she had been
slain, or carried away captive by the Indians. The
alarm spread from house to house. The whole village
was ready to pursue the enemy, and to recover the
lost one, or to revenge her death. Ah! revenge! as
if the lives of ten or of fifty of the foe could bring
back one spirit that had gone!</p>

<p class='pindent'>A small but ardent band was soon organized, and
ready for pursuit, with Young Russell at its head.
They struck at once upon the trail of the Indians,
and kept it without difficulty till they came to the
bank of the river at the foot of Mount Holyoke.
Here all traces of their course vanished. They had
evidently entered the river; but whether they had
crossed it, or only proceeded along its margin and
left it again on the same side at a distance below
could not be determined. The company here separated,
and one party crossed the river to search for
the trail on the other side, while the remaining party
scoured the eastern shores, but all in vain—no traces
of the enemy could be discovered. It was finally
conjectured that they had concealed their canoes in
the bushes and trees on the side and at the foot of
the mountain—and that after their defeat they had
hastened thither and embarked on the river, and
were by this time at such a distance as to defy pursuit
or discovery. Hour after hour did that little
band search the country round. Some climbed to the
summit of the mountain—some went far down the
broad river—here—there—and everywhere the
closest search was made—but still without success.
William now began to despair of the safety or rescue
of his betrothed. His heart grew sick—his cheek
paled—and he felt that it would be a boon to sit
down and die, if he could but be buried by the side of
his lost bride. And then, as he remembered the dispute
with Wawhillowa, and the truth flashed upon
him, his face flushed with anger, his teeth became
firmly set, and his breathing hard and laborious.
Again he started on—retraced the steps he had
taken, and hurried towards the island on which stood
Shaomet’s tent. When he arrived opposite the spot,
not seeing a canoe at hand, he threw himself into
the river, and soon found himself, breathless and exhausted,
at the door of the old man’s wigwam. He
entered abruptly—Shaomet sat alone, quietly smoking
his pipe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your daughter—where is she? Where is Tahattawa?”
cried William.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know not,” answered the old chief; “when I
awoke this morning, roused by the firing on the
plain, she had already left the wigwam, and I have
not seen her since.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is Wawhillowa, the Nonotuck prince?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have not seen him these many days; and yet I
think he has been about here, for Tahattawa has
seen him and had a long talk with him not longer
ago than yesterday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you heard that the Fair Flower, who used
so often to visit your tent, is lost?” asked William.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—some of your people came here to search
for her,” replied the Chief, shrugging his shoulders,
“but they might have known better than that. Shaomet
is old now—his hair has turned white—his
step is no longer light and swift, or he would help
you to find your poor lost one. She was a beautiful
Flower, and she and Tahattawa were the delight of
Shaomet’s old heart; but she is stolen now, and love
has proved stronger too in Tahattawa’s heart, than
her affection for her poor old father. She has left
me, I fear, to follow the young chief. But he is a
brave warrior, and worthy of her love. Many of his
enemies shall fall before his eye. He has a strong
arm and a steady hand, and—but here is Tahattawa!
She has not forsaken me”—and a flash of joy for a
moment kindled his sunken eye, as the light form of
his daughter bounded into the tent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stood for a moment panting from the effect of
recent and violent exercise. Oh! she was beautiful!
The rich, red blood could clearly be seen through the
dark skin,—her eye beamed, and her swelling breast
heaved with the excitement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you seen Eliza?” eagerly asked Russell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, she is a captive to the Nonotuck chief. I
saw him seize her, and bear her away in his arms.
How bravely it was done! But she was my sister.
I would not have her die. I followed them—my
step was light—he saw me not—heard me not; I
followed them to the encampment, and now I am
come to tell you where you may find her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why did you not give the alarm when you
saw him seize her?” impatiently demanded William.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl turned her rich dark eye full upon the
speaker, as she said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wawhillowa is the betrothed of Tahattawa, and
should she betray the life of her lover? No! my
sister shall be safe, but the brave chief must not die!
And now promise me that you will not seek his life,
and I will lead you to your bride.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I promise you,” said William.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, but the promise of a <span class='it'>pale-face</span> is easily
broken; you must swear it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>William did as he was required, and the two immediately
started to recover the captive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let us return to Wawhillowa and his companions.
Some six or eight miles down the river from Hockanum
island, on the east side of the range of hills
abruptly terminated by Mount Tom, and renewed
again on the other side of the Quonnecticut by Holyoke
and the peaks with which it is connected, is a
sort of natural amphitheatre, enclosed on three sides
by steep and precipitous hills, and on the other, towards
the river, closely shut in by a belt of dense
forest. This was the spot selected by the Indians as
a place of retreat should retreat be necessary; and
thither they had fled after the defeat at Hadley. The
spot was admirably calculated for the purpose of
concealment and security. The huge grey rocks
lifting their shaggy crests far above the little plain
at their base, seemed to bid defiance to all the world
around. The only way of access to the Indian encampment
was by striking through the forest that
separated it from the river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun had already gone down behind those rough
peaks, and the twinkling stars, one by one appearing
in the blue vault above, told that the night had come.
The pale moon was not looking on—yet it was a
bright and lovely night; too bright—oh! far too
beautiful for the many scenes of wickedness and
crime that were, all over the earth, about to be transacted
under its shades!</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the amphitheatre which we have described sat
the chiefs, who had that day been in the action, in
grave and solemn council. The causes of their defeat
were discussed, and it was determined that a
conciliatory offering must be made to the Great
Spirit, and that the captive maid must be the sacrifice.
Wawhillowa arose, and long, and earnestly,
and even eloquently pleaded for her life. He claimed
her as his own; he wished not for her death, but
chose to keep her for his slave. His suit was unsuccessful;
and when he sat down, a murmur of disapprobation
was all that he heard. The voice was
unanimous against him, and he was at last obliged
to acquiesce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>New fagots were thrown upon the council fire. The
dance began with slow and measured tread. The
fires blazed, and glared on the painted and hideous
countenances of the revellers, giving them an unearthly
and demon-like appearance. The march
quickened, and the wild song rose up in deep and
deadly tones, and was echoed back from those high
rocky hills. The stake was driven, and Wawhillowa
ordered the guard to bring forth the victim. The
man stirred not—answered not; and the chief himself
flew to the spot, burning with rage. He soon
came back with inflamed countenance, and muttering
curses deep and loud. The prisoner had fled—the
savage that had been left to guard her lay weltering
in his own gore! A wild, unearthly shout of fury
rent the air as the maddened savages learned their
disappointment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We left William Russell and the Indian maid, Tahattawa,
just leaving the wigwam of her father for
the rescue of Eliza Webster. They entered a light
canoe and glided swiftly down with the current of the
river. As they approached the place where the Indians
were encamped, the two travellers kept close
under the western bank, to be more secure against
the observation of any one who might have been stationed
as a look-out. By six o’clock they were
within a mile of the encampment, and here, by the
advice of the girl, Russell moored the canoe, and
they struck into the woods. Tahattawa, taking the
lead, glided through the dense bushes with surprising
facility—so swiftly indeed, that her companion
found some difficulty in keeping her in sight, although
his heart was continually prompting him to put forth
every effort. At length, just as the shades of night
began to appear, they caught a glimpse of the council
fire. They now proceeded with the utmost caution
till they came in sight of the wigwam in which the
prisoner was bound. Fortunately, it was placed on
that side of the opening which was nearest them, just
in the edge of the forest. Tahattawa crept along—keeping
the tent between herself and the Indians, till
she could look through a small hole in the rear. She
now motioned Russell to approach. He did so, and
looking through the opening, he saw, sitting, his lost
bride, her face buried in her hands. At the door of
the tent sat a brawny Indian, who, confident of the
security of his prisoner, was gazing towards the fire
and quietly smoking his pipe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tahattawa quickly drew William’s knife from his
belt, and, without the least noise, cut a large piece
from the thin bark-covering of the hut; then placing
the knife in Russell’s hand, she directed him by
signs, to enter, and despatch the savage. As he was
passing Eliza, she raised her head, and would have
screamed, had not Tahattawa been already at her
side, and covered her mouth with her hand. At that
moment the Indian turned his head; he grasped his
tomahawk, but before he could give a blow the hot
blood spurted from his heart, and he fell back and
died without a groan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fugitives now began, as rapidly as possible, to
retrace their steps towards the canoe, which had
been left concealed about a mile up the river. Their
progress, however, was slow, and the underwood
was very thick, and all three of the party were already
wearied with the toils of the day. Still they
struggled on, and, at length, succeeded in reaching
the spot where the canoe had been left, before the
hideous yell that came sweeping up the river warned
them but too surely that the escape of the prisoner,
and the death of the Indian in the wigwam, had been
discovered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Notwithstanding the fatigue of its occupants, the
light bark swiftly stemmed the broad current, its
sharp prow gracefully cutting the tiny waves as it
darted on, curling the water from its path as if it
disdained to touch them. And well might it be! for
that light craft held a bold heart and a strong arm—and
one too, that, had it not already been worn out by
exercise, would have laughed at pursuit. About one
half the distance between Hockanum Island, and the
place from which they started, had been gained,
when they heard anew the shouts of the Indians, and
looking round they saw two canoes about a quarter
of a mile below them in active pursuit. This was
but an incentive to fresh effort, for they well knew
that if they should be overtaken, instant death or
cruel tortures would be the fate awaiting two at least,
perhaps all three of the party. The Indian girl seized
a paddle and applied her strength in assisting the
young man, whose own was well nigh exhausted.
This aid was not inconsiderable, for though the girl
was not near as muscular as her companion, yet her
skill in managing the canoe was but little inferior to
his. They were now enabled to keep on without
losing ground, though safety was far from certain, as
several miles yet remained to be passed over, before
they could hope to find assistance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Directly in the gorge between Mount Holyoke and
Mount Tom is a short bend in the river, forming a
peninsula, now familiarly called “The Bellows,”
from its supposed resemblance to that article. The
distance around this peninsula is perhaps two or three
miles, while the direct course of the river is only
about fifty rods. The isthmus, connecting the bellows
with the main land, does not now exist as it did
then; for, a year or two since, the ice collecting in
the river just below, the water swept over the narrow
barrier, and washing away the earth, formed for
itself a new channel many feet in depth. When the
fugitives reached this isthmus they turned the canoe
towards the shore, and William, springing out, directed
the two girls to walk across the narrow strip
of land, while he should drag the light boat over to
the other bank. This was but an easy task, compared
with that of impelling it against the current,
for two or three miles—while the whole distance
was as effectually gained as if they had kept the
river. Fortunate was it for them that they adopted
this stratagem, and fortunate, too, that there was no
moon, and that the bushes from the foot of Holyoke
here swept to the very shore; for they had hardly
crossed half way over the isthmus before their pursuers
were opposite to them, close under the western
shore. As it was they were not discovered, and the
canoes in chase went sweeping round the whole
length of the stream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again the little party embarked, and hope began
to beat strong in their breasts. They pushed on with
renewed energy, and at length their eyes rested on
the little island of Hockanum. It is always a sweet
spot to look upon, but never did it appear so beautiful
to any eye as it did to them on that night when they
could just discern its dim outline.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are safe, Eliza, you are safe!” cried William.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the savages below, growing fearful of being
baffled in their pursuit, were pressing on with all
their strength; and the furious Wawhillowa, in the
foremost canoe, was continually urging on his men,
while he stood in the prow with his eyes eagerly
strained into the dim distance beyond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are safe!” cried William; but at the moment
a bullet whistled close by his head and gave the
lie to his exclamation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as the canoe touched the southern extremity
of the island, William sprang on shore, and
hurrying out the females, all three hastened to the
tent of Shaomet. The old man had been in waiting
for them, and, as soon as they entered, pointed to a
corner of the wigwam, where lay a heap of fagots
and a number of skins which he had prepared as a
means of concealment should concealment become
necessary. William quickly led Eliza to the spot,
and placing her behind the fagots threw the skins
over the top. While he was doing this, the yells of
the Indians grew louder and more terrific, for they
had now gained the island, and were certain of their
prey. William had scarcely turned away from the
corner where Eliza was concealed, when the door
was thrown violently open, and the savage features
of the Nonotuck chief glared full upon his face.
Quick as thought the rifle of Shaomet was in Russell’s
hand and levelled full at the Indian’s breast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold, hold!” cried Tahattawa, “your promise—your
oath!” and she snatched at the rifle. It was
too late. William had already fired, and the tall
form of Wawhillowa fell heavily to the ground.
The poor girl turned mournfully away, and, covering
her face with her hands, burst into a flood of tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time the other canoe had come up, and six
or eight stout Indians were surrounding the wigwam.
They immediately drew away the body of their
chief; and, as it fell outwards, those within were uncertain
whether or not the wound was mortal. A
council was now held by the besiegers as to what
mode of action should be adopted. Some proposed
to fire through the sides of the hut; others to burn
it; but both of these plans were rejected, as it would
endanger the lives of Shaomet and his daughter,
which was far from being their object; for Shaomet
had been a bold and renowned chief, and still possessed
much influence among the neighboring tribes;
while the beauty of the girl obtained for her an influence
and celebrity, but little less extensive than
her father’s, though of an entirely different kind. At
last it was decided to burst into the wigwam, and secure
the fugitives, doing no harm to the old man or
his daughter, even though they had endeavored to
give protection to their enemy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whilst they were hesitating what course to pursue,
William reloaded the rifle, together with an old
musket which he found hanging in the tent. As soon
as the door opened, and an Indian appeared, he fired.
The shot was effectual, but still the odds were fearful.
Another and another savage entered, and the
foremost had already levelled his rifle at William’s
heart. The musket was in Shaomet’s hand; with
the quickness of his youth he brought the piece to
his shoulder. It missed fire. In another instant William
Russell lay a bleeding corpse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They immediately advanced to secure his scalp,
but the old man would not permit them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have killed my friend,” said he, “in my
own wigwam, and now I will protect his body while
I live. Shaomet is old now—he will soon be buried
with his fathers; you may shoot me if you will, but
never shall you take his scalp.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this time Tahattawa sat upon the bundle of
fagots in the corner of the tent. She spoke not—moved
not. For the sake of her friend—her <span class='it'>sister</span>
as she familiarly called her—she had perilled her
own life; nay, what was far more, the life of her
betrothed. She had seen her “<span class='it'>sister’s</span>” lover shot
down—she had seen her own young chief fall, and
of course supposed him dead. Poor girl! A victim
to her own benevolence and to the evil passions of
others!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The savages, casting a glance round the apartment,
and perceiving no other inmate besides Shaomet and
his daughter, immediately left the wigwam, and,
taking their canoes, went silently down the river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the afternoon following the events above related,
the little island of Hockanum looked as bright
and as beautiful as ever. It was as lovely as if it
had not witnessed the tragic scenes of the preceding
night. The bright sun shone gaily upon it; the birds
warbled their sweet notes; the soft breeze played
among the bright green leaves; and the whole spot
looked like a little paradise;—a sad contrast to two
hearts that were even then in its bosom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The friends of William Russell had already assembled
to perform the last sad duties to his remains.
He was to be interred here, in accordance with the
request of her who was to have been his bride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here,” said she, “here on this little island he
was slain, and here let him be buried. Here I will
spend many of my hours; I will plant flowers around
his grave. Here I can come and weep, away from
all eyes but the eye of Him who has seen fit to afflict
me thus.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ceremony had just been performed and they
were just turning away from the grave, when all eyes
were directed to a canoe which was slowly moving
up the river. It had two occupants. One sat motionless
in the stern—the other was gently using the
paddle. As it approached the island, Tahattawa regarded
it with a fixed and earnest gaze. As she did
so her heart beat quick and her eyes darted with joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is—it is <span class='it'>he</span>,” cried she, “Wawhillowa;” and
away she bounded to the shore. As the canoe
touched the bank, the Indian, who sat in the stern,
stepped on shore. The next instant his companion
pushed off, turned down the stream, and quickly disappeared
from view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wawhillowa—for it was he—advanced with a
few staggering, uncertain steps towards the girl, but
before they met, he fell headlong on the ground.
Those who had been standing around the grave now
approached. The girl sat holding his head, and
chafing his temples with her hands. He had fainted.
The blood was slowly oozing from a wound by a rifle
ball in the right breast. It appeared to have bled
considerably, for it had run down even to his ankle,
and the right leggin was deeply stained. Tahattawa
looked the very image of despair. Hope had been
kindled in her breast only to be destroyed, and her
poor heart could hardly contain its grief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shaomet ran to his tent, and brought a calabash
full of water from the river, and some being sprinkled
on the face of the young warrior, he slowly revived.
Turning a melancholy glance on those around them,
his eye brightened for a moment, and the sternness
of his features relaxed as his look rested on the face
of his betrothed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tahattawa,” said he, in a feeble voice, “I am
dying. Bury me—here—on the island. I am
going—to the—happy—hunting grounds. See!—the
spirit—of my father—calls me.—Ha! It
grows dark—Tahattawa!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The poor girl bent over him till her face rested on
his bosom. When she again raised her eyes, the
spirit of the Nonotuck chief had departed, and she
looked on the cold, fixed features of the dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another grave was dug close by the side of the one
which had just been filled. Some of the friends of
the “pale-face” objected to the burial of an Indian
so near the body of their own kindred, but the sisters
wished it, and their feelings were regarded. He was
buried, after the manner of his people—his face towards
the rising sun. His hunting weapons were
buried with him. There they lay—two fierce and
haughty spirits. They would not hold fellowship in
life, but in <span class='it'>death</span> they sleep side by side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From that hour the hearts of the two survivors
were as one. Theirs had been a sad and mournful
fate. Their destinies were similar. They lived—lived
long—and as happily as two could live whose
first dream of bliss had been thus cruelly broken.
They lived to atone for the faults of those whom
they had loved. They were never separated during
their lives, and nearly at the same time the summons
came to both to go and meet their Judge. They
have long since passed away. Their clay has “returned
to earth as it was, and their spirits have gone
to the God who gave them.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY THEODORE S. FAY, AUTHOR OF “NORMAN LESLIE,” “THE COUNTESS IDA,” ETC.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>HAMLET.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>None</span> of Shakspeare’s characters are insignificant.
If I had been Garrick or Mrs. Siddons, I should have
tried sometimes, as an experiment, the most apparently
trifling of his personages. I believe they would
give room for striking development, only there is this
objection—neither Siddons nor Garrick, nor any other
of the great actors <span class='it'>could</span> take parts promiscuously
from the crowd. They are too unlike each other.
They are too essentially different identities to permit
of being represented by one. Garrick might
take Macbeth in the play—and <span class='it'>Scrub</span> in the after-piece,
and do them both well; but he could not play
equally well with two such opposite characters by
Shakspeare. No actor has appeared <span class='it'>capable</span> of playing
all his principal tragic <span class='it'>rôles</span> well. It is sufficient
honor to attain to the height of illustrating one or
two. Kean, for example, was very great in Lear and
Richard. He was fine, by starts, in Othello, but not
equally so. He wanted sustained simplicity and calm
grandeur. Othello was a hero of nature: he had the
quiet self respect of a long successful soldier. Kean
did not satisfy me, as a whole, in Othello. I like
Forrest, in many respects, better. I saw Forrest play
the part at Drury Lane one night far beyond what I
had ever seen before; particularly the first half of the
play was perfect; the last I thought wanted, although
in a slight degree, that mellowing and chastening
which time gives to a painting, and will, doubtless,
perhaps <span class='it'>has</span> given, to this part of that dignified and
impressive portraiture. He carried with him a
crowded and intellectual audience—and, at certain
points, profound and unbreathing silence—the highest
applause—indicated the grasp this distinguished tragedian
had on the minds of the people who have beheld
the character so often and so grandly given—and so
often and ably criticised. Cassio’s drunken scene was
full of the thrilling strokes of a master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the characters in these plays we may always
speak as of historical characters—as if they had
lived—just as the poet drew them. Men always do
speak of them so. The <span class='it'>opinions</span>, even of these Shakspearian
men and women, have authority in the senate
and the field—at the bar and in the pulpit. Many a
statesman—many an editor has struck at his antagonist
with a citation, not from <span class='it'>Shakspeare</span>, but from
his men and women. By a common consent of two
centuries, Othello and Macbeth, Lear and Coriolanus,
have <span class='it'>lived</span>—they have been substantial beings—their
real historical individuality has passed into their
dramatic being—and they appeal to our minds from
the scenes where Shakspeare left them. So with all
his vast crowd of people. A young man who has
made himself really acquainted with this assemblage,
will have formed valuable friends and advisers; and
should he select properly the persons whose opinions
he means to act on, he will live a happier and a wiser
life than he could without them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have said there is no insignificant character in
Shakspeare; so I may say there is scarcely one which
would not make the subject of an interesting volume.
As classes of men, scores of volumes might yet be
written on the kings, the queens, the generals, the
rebels, the usurpers—on the mothers, the children,
the self-murderers, the assassins—on the poor and
the rich, the innocent and the guilty—on the supernatural
characters—on the noblemen and the peasants—on
the fools and drunkards—on the spirits—on
justices and physicians, landlords and servants—on
sea captains, lawyers and executioners—on mobs
and fairies—on Spaniards, Italians, English and
Frenchmen—on Romans, Jews, shepherds, shepherdesses
and wenches, courtiers, pages, etc., etc.,
etc. Indeed, there is scarcely an end to the various
relations in which his characters may be considered;
each one may be performed with effect. Nature has
made, or will make, some particular mortals gifted
with a distinct capacity to represent one of each of
them—as Mrs. Siddons was for Lady Macbeth, and
Kean for Lear. The greatest actors seem but prophets
fitted to illustrate one or two of his creations. Some
of them have never yet been represented as they may
be. Probably Lady Macbeth, and Queen Catharine,
in Henry VIII. will never be better given—as also
Richard, Lear, and several others; but I suspect
many of the subordinate <span class='it'>rôles</span> are yet to be filled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There really are many indications which bear out
the praise of the commentators, that this world was
not <span class='it'>large</span> enough for his genius. His spirits, magicians,
monsters, and ghosts, are evidences of it.
Other writers have resorted to these materials before
him, but only as a mode of acting on human feelings.
It was reserved for Shakspeare to make us as well
acquainted with the secret heart of a <span class='it'>ghost</span> as of a
mortal. Hamlet’s spectre not only frightens and
startles us—he touches our feelings. We see into
that unearthly mind—that solitary, disembodied
being—revisiting the scene of its mortal life, but indicating,
fearfully, by its stealthy dim night walks—the
solemn march with which it goes slow and
stately by—its allusions to things too frightful for
human ears—its guilty starting at the crowing of
the cock, and its hurrying back to its nameless and
awful task—its anguish-stricken bewailings over the
earthly state of peace and happiness from which it
was so ruthlessly hurled—indicating by all these
and many more expressive tokens, the dark and sublime
load of woe it bears, and appealing to our
sympathy with terrible power. Ulrici may have
found, in this scene, grounds for his theory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The character of the unhappy exile from earth to
the secret and impenetrable abode of spirits, is drawn
with as much reality as that of Hamlet or the grave
digger. There are two or three touches of individuality
which invest it with a singular attraction. It is
not only a ghost; it is <span class='it'>the</span> ghost of a particular individual—of
a majestic, noble, benevolent, affectionate
king, overwhelmed by a mighty calamity: the victim
of the most shameful lewdness—the blackest treachery
that ever was seen—and deploring, “in fire,”
the “foul crimes” done in his “days of nature.” We
are not to presume he had been a peculiarly wicked
man, but he was <span class='it'>suddenly</span> called to his account before
he could <span class='it'>prepare himself to die</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What a sublime hint of Christianity is this, and
how fraught with a tremendous lesson to all mankind.
Death itself is not the misfortune; it is death
to an unprepared spirit. That he was</p>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>I have always thought this one of the sublimest and
most terrible reaches of our author’s genius. All
earthly misfortunes, regarded in their temporary
consequences are, of course, unworthy to be placed
in comparison with the misfortune of the immortal
disembodied soul. The wreck of old Lear’s mind,
the agonizing fall of Othello from bliss, the banishment
and murder of Coriolanus, the stern fate of the
sweet Juliet and her tender Romeo—all fall short of
the horror of this spectral lamentation, coming up
from the central caves of the earth, or the yet more
unimaginable caverns of hell itself, and deploring in
the “dead waste and middle of the night,” the vast,
dire and unnameable wo it suffers from its unreflecting
manner of living while yet a mortal tenant of the
globe, and when the means of <span class='it'>making its reckoning</span>
were yet within its power, and had been so unwisely
neglected. Had this unhappy creature been a thinking
and pious person, the sudden blow would not have
found it unprepared. It would not have been wasting
the precious hours of age in the <span class='it'>blossoms of its sin</span>.
It would not have deferred the imperative duty of
making its peace with the creator, and of endeavoring,
(<span class='it'>before</span> the condemnation “to fast in fire”) to
purify itself from earthliness—from the enervating
and selfish tendencies of luxury and royal power, and
from the soils and weaknesses of youthful passions,
uncurbed, and the follies—perhaps we may also with
justice term them “foul crimes”—which all mortals
commit in a greater or less degree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In these few words is a grave lesson to the men of
the present living world. Many of the most prominent
characters in history have felt, in time, the importance
of the mighty truth which this “poor ghost”
had neglected—and, by withdrawing from active
life, as old age came on, and devoting themselves to
reflection, to self-examination and self-purification,
to thoughts of death and communion with their
Maker, have endeavored to prepare themselves for
the closing scene. Men require this process. We
are all heated with the cares and passions of life, and
cherish in our breasts flames which ought to be extinguished
before we enter the presence of our Maker.
Some abandon themselves to such unworthy wishes,
to such mean, selfish and ridiculous opinions and
determinations, that the years of ordinary old age
cannot be too long to enable us to regain our balance,
and to recover (or if we have never had it, to acquire)
the dignity of a moral being. What a picture is presented
to the imagination by the thought of a <span class='it'>miser</span>
standing before the throne of God. How would a
<span class='it'>profligate</span> feel, restored, as he will be by death, to a
true estimation of himself, on being thrust suddenly
before the dread tribunal; or, what would be the sensations
of an arrogant, presumptuous man, going
through life with no thought but himself and his own
greatness, on being, like the ghost of Hamlet, “cut
off” even in the blossoms of his sins, <span class='it'>no reckoning
made</span>, “but sent to his account” with all his imperfections
on his head? What would be the feelings of
any mere worldly man—one who had been a cruel
persecutor and oppressor—who had taken the bread
from the widow and orphan?</p>

<p class='pindent'>All men have not sinned equally, but all men have
sinned. It is not likely any one has gone through
the world without having an opportunity of feeling,
with a most bitter humiliation, the innate depravity
and woful weakness of human nature, unless <span class='it'>sustained</span>
by the creating hand. Trusted to themselves the
stoutest will faint, the purest will be soiled. The
events of life act upon the heart with a kind of
chemical power, extracting from it baseness and
weakness, as poison may be extracted from flowers.
Perhaps this is capable of being turned to good, if
read aright. For the heart which has looked in upon
itself, with distrust and shame, is wiser and purer
than any other: it is stronger also. To come to the
feet of the Creator with a <span class='it'>true</span> trust in him, is almost
impossible, till we have seen the shipwreck of self
confidence, and felt that by ourselves we are less than
nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a life, then, of action, and of temptation, of
false hopes, ill placed affections, frivolous desires
and enjoyments, and perhaps impious and guilty
occupations, how happy he who has the wisdom to
break away from them <span class='it'>himself</span>, before inexorable
fate calls him, and who cleanses and prepares his
spirit for the great change it is destined to undergo.
I will not enter here upon the graver tenets of religion,
but surely we may believe that he who sees
in time the nature of sin, and disentangles himself
from its snares—who spends the latter years of his
life in a sincere endeavor to become what he ought to
be, and to release his spirit from the world before his
body is called away, if he cannot wholly efface the
traces of sin, may soften them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For my part, although not an old man, I begin
already to look upon human life more as a spectator
than an actor, and to feel myself within the sublime
and mysterious attraction of another world. I distrust
the effect upon me of the collisions, temptations
and pleasures which I may yet have to encounter—and
I feel a hesitation even in wishing for
wealth or worldly honors. The idea of a hereafter—of
the actual visible presence of my Maker—is becoming
every day less remote and more familiar to
me. It hushes the voice of indignation, and checks
the impulse of contempt—which, when I keep my
eyes on this world alone, I cannot always master.
It teaches me that my mortal part, as far as related
to earthly things, is a brief, passing shadow—that
the world is but the reflection of one point in the
career of the soul—that human vice and folly are
but mysteries of nature, and that human passions
were given us as our slaves—not our masters.
No medicine—no magnetism can have a more
striking influence than this thought, upon the physical
as well as the moral part of me; and when I
enter the chamber where a dead man is lying, I feel
all that is <span class='it'>bad</span> within me so rebuked, silenced and
destroyed—and all that is good so awakened, so
pure, sustaining and holy, that I have little enthusiasm
to search after the vain phantoms of mere earthly
philosophy, or earthly happiness. I see only the form
of religion, ever calm, ever young, standing above the
wreck of the mortal universe, and pointing to another
and a better one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What a powerful stroke of dramatic art is it then
in our great poet to throw this idea, not into the voice
of a sage or a preacher, but to announce it to startled
generations from the dim faded lips of a suffering
spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It has been a custom with many great characters,
both of ancient and modern times, to devote the latter
part of their lives to this moral preparation. It seems
as if a kind Providence had conceived old age on purpose
for this process. If we have lived properly, our
minds will then have become cultivated in proportion
as the body, that great tempter, has been weakened;
and we are called upon to retire from the active
world just when we are become unfit for it. Yet how
many old men do we see clinging to its gilded toys,
empty hopes, and frivolous amusements, without a
thought of any thing beyond; or, how many a grey
head is at this moment working schemes which might
better become the imagination of the thoughtless
school-boy, or the grovelling nature of the brute. In
how many a heart, which should be the altar only for
the pure, silent, undying flame of piety, do we see
the unholy passions of earth burning beneath a hand
which ever feeds with the impurest food their vain
fires. How few are there among aged men who have
thought of letting loose their hold on earth, of slackening
their pursuit after wealth or vain distinctions,
of turning their minds to the period (which to-morrow
may bring) when all things not connected
with their future career shall seem to them like infant
toys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I often think of that poor ghost’s touching lament,
and hope that death may not find me thus unprepared.
I take a profound lesson from this profoundest of
mortal teachers, and learn to go through the earth
like a passing traveller, paying but a brief visit of
curiosity and instruction to its beautiful wonders, but
who does not mean to build, even in the fairest of its
bowers, or by the most tempting of its streams—because
his home is in another country, to which all
that he has and all that he loves is either gone or
going.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How deeply Shakspeare—even the laughter-loving,
etherial, sunshiny Shakspeare, was impressed with
the same thought, you may gather from his works.
It is not the night-walking spirit alone who utters to
mankind this sublime truth, but the most high climbing
and successful of his living personages also proclaim
it. <span class='it'>Prospero</span>, among others, in a solemn and
touching remark, betrays how full he is of the
nothingness of mere human life. After having given
utterance to that most magnificent of all the sublime
breathings of a thoughtful mind—</p>

it hangs a beautiful mystery which has not, that I

<p class='noindent'>and yet, by a mysterious exercise of power, obliged
to obey an art sufficiently strong to control his
“dam’s god Setebos.” I am so accustomed, in the
works of Shakspeare, as in those of nature, to look
for meaning where all seems most capricious, that I
dwell with a kind of delightful curiosity over the
grand and not yet all explained lessons of this fascinating
creation. What a delightful amusement for
an old age of leisure to relieve its graver moments by
a habitual study of Shakspeare!</p>

<p class='pindent'>To return a moment to the spirit of Hamlet. The
<span class='it'>human traces</span> found in this pale spectre are great
heighteners of our interest in it, and of the probabilities
of its existence. The return to Elsinore, and to
the platform before the castle, in the night, when the
sentinels are on guard—its appearance first to the
soldiers on the watch—then to Horatio, who has
been induced to watch by the report of it—its sudden
appearance, and equally abrupt disappearance—giving
an idea of capricious impulses and laws not
within the reach of mortal conjecture—its seeking
out <span class='it'>its son</span> as the confidant of the amazing secret,
are all ghost-like, and yet show the shadow of mortality.
Its dismal, half-breathed, mysterious revelations
of what it is undergoing in its new abode, are
spectral to the last degree; but there is nothing which
elevates it to a higher and nobler place in our commiseration,
than the exquisitely tender allusion to
the guilty queen. This is the mortal, always majestic,
superior, merciful and refined—but now enlightened
and subdued by the influences of its new
state.</p>

<div><h1><a id='rom'></a>THE ROMAN BRIDE.</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>A TALE OF THE WESTERN EMPIRE.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY THE AUTHOR OF “THE BROTHERS,” “CROMWELL,” “RINGWOOD THE ROVER,” ETC.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> might and glory which had of yore reared
the imperial city to its throne of universal domination,
had long ago departed from the degenerate and
weak posterity of the world’s conquerors! The
name of Roman was but the lucid meteor of the
charnel imparting a faint lustre to corruption and
decay! The bold hordes of the hardy north had
oftentimes already avenged the wrongs done by the
elder Cæsar, while the frail silken puppets, who had
succeeded to his style and station, trembled in the
unguarded capital at every rumor from beyond the
Danube. For, to the limits of that mighty river had
they extended, years before the time of which we
write, their arms, their arts, their sciences, and their
religion—the pure and holy doctrines of the crucified
Redeemer. All the Dalmatian coast of the bright
gulf of Venice, now little more known than the
wilds of central Asia, was studded with fair towns,
and gorgeous palaces, and gay suburban villas; and
all the wide spread plains of Thrace and Thessaly,
now forest-clad and pathless, save to the untamed
klepht or barbarous tartar, waved white with crops
of grain, and blushed with teeming vineyards, and
nurtured a dense happy population. At times indeed
the overwhelming deluge of barbarian warfare had
burst upon those fertile regions; and, wheresoever
it burst,</p>

<p class='line0'>Their arms, their arts, their gods were whirled away—”</p>

<p class='noindent'>yet ever, when the refluent billows ebbed, the grass
had sprung up green and copious even in the horse
tramps of the innumerable cavalry that swelled the
armies of the north, and the succeeding summer had
smiled on meads and vineyards abundant as before,
and on a population careless and free and jocund.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But now a mightier name was on the wind—a
wilder terror was abroad—Attila!—Attila—the
dread Hun! Still all as yet was peace; and, although
rumors were abroad of meetings beyond the Danube;
of the bent bow—emblem of instant warfare—sent
with the speed of horse o’er moor, morass, and
mountain—although the tribute, paid yearly by the
degenerate Cæsars, had been refused indignantly by
the bold Marcian—bold, and wise, and worthy the
best days of the republic!—although from all these
tokens prudent men had foreseen the wrath to come,
and brave men armed to meet it, and cowards fled
before it; still careless and improvident the crowd
maintained their usual demeanor, and toiled, and
laughed, and bought, and sold, and feasted, and
slept sound o’ nights, as though there were no such
things on earth as rapine, and revenge, and merciless
unmitigated war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was as sweet and beautiful an evening in the
early autumn as ever looked down with bright and
cheerful smile from the calm heavens upon man’s
hour of rest, what time the labor and the burthen of
the day all past and over, he gathers round him his
blythe household, and no more dreaming of anxiety
or toil or sorrow, looks confidently forward to a
secure night and happy morrow. And never did the
eye of day, rising or sitting, look down from his
height upon a brighter or a happier assemblage than
was gathered on that evening in a sweet rural villa,
scarce a mile distant from the gates of Singidurum
one of the frontier towns of Masia on the Danube.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a wedding eve—the wedding of two beings
both young and beautiful and loving. Julia, the
fairest of the province, the bright and noble daughter
of its grave proconsul, famed for her charms, her
arts, her wit and elegance, even in the great Rome
itself before her father had taken on himself—alas!
in an evil hour—the duties and the honors of that
remote provincial government—and brave Aurelius,
the patrician—Aurelius, who, though not yet had he
reached his thirtieth summer, had fought in nine
pitched battles, besides affairs of posts and skirmishes
past counting—won no less than five civic crowns,
for the lives saved of Romans on the field, and
collars, and horse trappings, and gold bracelets, as
numerous as were awarded to the deeds of Marius,
when valor was a common virtue in Rome’s martial
offspring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were a noble pair, and beautiful, as noble—well-matched—she,
light as the summer cloud and
airy as its zephyr and graceful as the vine that waves
at every breath—he vigorous and tall as the young
oak before the blight of eld has gnarled one giant
limb or scathed one wreath of its dark foliage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Delicate, fair, and slender and tall beyond the
middle height of woman with a waist ‘shaped to
love’s wish’ and every graceful outline full of rich
rounded symmetry, young Julia was a thing to dream
of as the inhabitant of some far bright Elysian,
rather than to behold as an inmate of the rude heartless
world. It seemed as though it were a sin that
the sun’s ardent kiss should visit her transparent
cheek too warmly, that any breath but that of the
softest summer gale should wanton in the luxuriant
ringlets of her long silky auburn hair—her eyes
were blue and clear as the bosom of some pure
moonlit fountain, and there was in them a wild, yet
not unquiet gaze, half languor and half tenderness.
She was indeed a creature but little fitted to battle
with the cares and sorrows of this pilgrimage, and
as she leaned on the stalwart arm of her warrior
lover, hanging upon him as if confident in his vast
strength and relying absolutely on his protection,
and fixing the soft yearning gaze of those blue eyes
full on his broad brow and expressive lineaments, no
one could doubt that she had chosen well the partner
who should support and guide her through this vale of
tears and sin and sorrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But who thought then of tears—who ever dreamed
of sorrow? The day had been passed happily—alas!
how happily!—in innocent and pure festivity—the
blythe dance on the velvet greensward, the joyous
ramble amid the trelliced vines, the shadowy cypresses,
the laurelled mazes of the garden; with lyre and
lute and song, and rich peals of the mellow flute
and melancholy horn blent with the livelier clashing
of the cymbals, waking at intervals the far and
slumbering echoes of the dark wilderness beyond the
Danube. Oh! had they but known what ears were
listening to their mirthful music, what eyes were
gloating with the fierce lust of barbarous anticipation
on their fair forms and radiant faces, what hearts
were panting amid the dense and tangled forests for
the approaching nightfall—how would their careless
mirth have been converted into despair and dread
and anguish, their languishing and graceful gait into
precipitate and breathless flight—those blythe light
hearted beings!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun set glowing in the west—glowing with
the bright promise of a lovely morrow—and many
an eye dwelt on his waning glories, and drew bright
augeries from the rich flood of lustre, which streamed
in hues of varying rose and gold up to the purpled
zenith; while on the opposite verge of heaven, the
full orbed moon had hung already her broad shield of
virgin silver, with Lucifer the star of love kindling
his diamond lamp beside her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Farewell, great sun—and blessings be upon thy
course”—whispered Aurelius to his lovely bride, as
hanging fondly on his arm, she watched from the Ionic
porticoes of spotless Parian marble, the last sun of
her maiden days—“that thou hast set so calm and
bright, and with such promise of a glorious future—Hail,
Julia, Hail with me the happy omen!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow”—she replied in tones of eloquent
music, half blushing as she spoke even at the intensity
of her own feelings—“To-morrow, my Aurelius,
I shall be thine, all thine!”—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And art thou not all mine, even now, beloved—By
the bright heavens above us—for long—long
years!—my heart with all its hopes and fears and
aspirations, my life with its whole crime and purpose—my
soul with its very essence and existence
have been thine—all! all thine—my Julia—and
art not thou mine, now!—why what save death
should sever us?—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Talk not of death!”—she answered with a
slight shiver running through all her frame—“Talk
not of death, Aurelius—I feel even now as if his
icy breath was blowing on my spirit, his dim and
awful shadow reflecting darkness on my every
thought—dost thou believe, Aurelius, that passing
shades like these, which will at times sadden and
chill the soul, are true presentiments of coming evil?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That do I not—sweet love”—he answered—“that
do I not believe; when by chance or some
strain of highly wrought and thrilling sentiment the
heart-strings of us mortals are attuned too high
beyond their wont, like harp chords, they will harmonize
to any sound or sentiment that accords to
their own spirit pitch; and, neither sad nor joyous in
themselves, will respond readily to either grief or
sorrow: that, feeling no cause for mirth or gloom,
we fancy them prophetic feelings, when they are
but reflected tones, and so disquiet ourselves often
with a vain shadow!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,”—she replied, still sadly—“I wish it may
be so, as I suppose it is. Yet—yet—I would it
were to-morrow!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, come! I must not have thee thus sad on
an eve like this, my Julia—lo! they have lighted
up the hall—and the banquet is spread, and the
wine poured—the queen of the feast must not be
absent!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And shaking off the gloom which had, she knew
not why, oppressed her, she turned with one long
lingering last glance to the sun as he disappeared
behind the dark tree tops which seemed to swallow
him up in an unnatural gloom, and entered the vast
hall which, hung with tapestries of silk and gold,
and garlanded with wreaths of choice flowers, and
reeking with unnumbered perfumes, lighted with
lamps of gold pouring their soft illumination over the
gorgeous boards, shewed like a very palace of the
senses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bridal strains burst forth harmonious at the first,
and slow and solemn, but quickening and thrilling
as they rose, till every ear that heard them responded
to their enlivening impulse, and every bosom glowed
and panted to their expressive cadences. The wine
went round, and laughter circled with it, and many a
tender glance was interchanged, and many a whisper
that called up burning blushes, and many a pressure
of young hands betwixt those, who hoped that as
this night to Julia and Aurelius, so should one be for
them at no far distant!—and many prayed that
such might be their lot—and many envied them!—Oh
God, what blinded worms we be—when left to
our own guidance!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bridal feast was over—the bridal hymns
were hushed—the banquet hall was left deserted—for
in an inner chamber all hung with spotless white
at a small altar placed beneath a cross gorgeous with
gold and jewels stood Julia and Aurelius—the
tender and solicitous mother and the gray headed
noble father at her side—the priest of God before
them, and all the joyous company hushed in mute
awe, that arose not from fear—and the faith of that
bright pair was plighted, and the gold ring set on the
slender finger, and the last blessing was pronounced,
and they two were made one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just in that breathless pause as the words of the
priest ceased to sound, although their cadences were
still ringing in the ears of all who heard them—there
was a sudden rustle heard without, and a dread cry.
“The city!—the city!—Singidurum!” So piercing
was the cry, that not one of all those who heard it,
but felt that something dreadful was in progress—in
an instant the whole company rushed out into the
portico—and lo! one flood of crimson flame was
soaring up the sky from what an hour before had been
a beauteous and a happy town—and a confused din
of roars and howls burst with the shrill yells of
despairing women, the clash of arms, and the thundering
downfall of towns, palaces, and temples,
filled the whole atmosphere with fiendish uproar.
Scarce had they time to mark, or comprehend what
they beheld, before, about them, and around, on every
side came the thick beating hoofs—and in another
moment they might see the myriads of the Hunish
horsemen circling them in on every side, and cutting
off all hope of flight or rescue with a dark living
rampart. “Romans,” Aurelius shouted—“Romans
to arms—for life, and liberty, and vengeance!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His words were obeyed instantly, for all perceived
their truth—but what availed it? To hew down a
dozen trees and batter down the village gates was
but a moment’s work for the blood-thirsty hordes
who swarmed around the building. The outer gate
was shattered in a moment—the inner, frailer yet,
gave at the first assault, and now no bulwark was
left any longer to the Romans save in their own good
swords and stalwart sinews! Bravely they fought—aye,
desperately—heaping the marble floors with
mangled carcasses, and dying, each man where he
stood, where the sword smote or javelin pierced him,
dauntless and undismayed. Long they fought, for
each Roman slain cutting down ten barbarians—but
by degrees they were borne back—back at the
sword’s point, foot by foot—and marking every step
by their own streaming gore. At the hour’s end but
five were left—five, and all wounded, and one old:
the father of the wretched Julia, Aurelius and his
brother, and two young nobles of the province. Retreating,
step by step, they were at last driven back
into the bridal chamber—the altar stood there yet,
and the great cross above it, and the priest clinging
to the cross, and at his feet the bride, with her fair
tresses all dishevelled and all her lovely comrades
prostrate upon the ground around her. The door
was barred within—brief respite, no defence—and
the strong men leaned upon their weapons in despair
and gazed on one another, and then from one another
to the women. It was a sad and awful scene. A
rush of heavy feet was heard without—a halt, and
then a rustling sound, with now a clang of steel and
now the clatter of a grounded spear, as if the multitude
was getting silently into array and order—a
pause, and a loud cry!—“Attila!—Attila!—the
king!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then came a slow and measured footstep striding
up to the door—one short and heavy blow upon the
pannel, as with a sword’s hilt—and a stern, grave
voice exclaimed “Open!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will,” answered Aurelius, “they would destroy
it in an instant—it is but one chance in a myriad,
but best trust to his mercy.” With the words he
drew back bar after bar, and threw the door wide
open—and there! there on the very threshold, with
his swart cicatrized features, and short, square, athletic
form, sheathed in scale armor of a strange device,
with the hideous Charntean head gleaming out
grim and awful from his breastplate, and the strange
sword—all iron, hilt and blade, and guard and scabbard—his
weapon and his God, firmly grasped in
his right hand, but as yet bloodless—there stood
the dreadful Hun!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Death,” he exclaimed—“Death to all who resist,”
in tones singularly deep and stern and solemn—“Mercy
to those who yield them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do with <span class='it'>us</span> as thou wilt, great king,” returned
Aurelius steadily, lowering as he spoke his sword’s
point—“but spare our women’s honour!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Down with thy weapon, or die, Roman!” thundered
the monarch, striding forward as he spoke and
raising his sword high.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The terms, great Attila?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Death for resistance!—Mercy for surrender!—A
king’s love for fair women!” shouted the Hun,
enraged at finding opposition where he dreamed not
of meeting any, and his blood fired almost beyond
endurance by the exquisite charms of the women,
whom he could clearly see beyond their few defenders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then die, Aurelius! die as becomes a Roman—and
by the Heavens above us both, I will die with
you,” exclaimed Julia, nerved by despair to courage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha! wilt thou?” exclaimed Attila; “Onegisus,
reserve that girl who spoke so boldly, and that black-haired
maid with the jewelled collar, for the king’s
pleasure! Make in, Huns,” he added in an appalling
shout—“kill, win, enjoy—but leave this dog to
me!” and with the word he assailed, sword in hand,
the new-made husband. One deadly close charge,
and the four defenders were hewn down—yea! hewn
limb from limb, by a hundred weapons—and then
what followed was too terrible for words—enough!
all that war has most horrible—murder and agony
and violation, in their worst, most accursed shapes,
reigned there and revelled fiends incarnate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Onegisus had seized the bride and the other wretched
girl indicated by the king, and they were for the
moment safe among the tumult—and still Aurelius
and Attila fought hand to hand, unwounded, and
well paired, a perilous and deadly duel. And ever
as she stood there, unconscious of the hellish deeds
that were in progress round her, she gazed with a
calm, fearless eye upon her bridegroom. Onegisus
had her grasped firmly by the left arm, and as she
neither strove, nor shrieked, nor struggled, but stood
still as a marble statue, he thought no more about
it, but gazed himself with all his eyes upon the combat.
At last, as if by mutual consent, the champions
paused for breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thou art brave, Roman,” said the Hun, in his
deep, stern, low tones, not seeming in the least degree
disturbed or out of wind—“Attila loves the
brave!—Live and be free!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Her honour, mighty Attila—my young bride’s
honour—be merciful and generous as thou art brave
and noble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Choose—fool!” the king exclaimed in a voice
resembling more the growl of a famished tiger than
any human sound—“choose between life or death!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Death or her honor!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then die—idiot—Roman!” sneered the other,
and with a fearful cry, grinding his teeth till the
foam flew from them as from the tusks of a hunted
boar, he leaped upon Aurelius. Three deadly blows
were interchanged, and at each blow a wound—but
at the fourth, Attila’s sword descending like a thunderbolt,
shivered the Roman’s blade into a thousand
pieces, and, glancing from his helmet, alighted on
his shoulder, and clove deep into his chest!—he
staggered forward, and at the next instant met the
sword’s point, driven home by a tremendous thrust
into his very vitals. Headlong he fell backward;
but, as he fell, his glazing eyes turned fearfully toward
his loved Julia—they glazed fast—but he
saw, and smiled in dying, and died happy! For, as
the last blow fell, she saw the fight was over—and
by a sudden movement, the less expected from her
complete and passive quietude, she snatched a long
knife from the girdle of Onegisus, and before he well
knew what she had done, much less had time to prevent
it, had stabbed herself three times—each time
mortally—into her virgin bosom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Husband,” she cried, “I come!—true to my
word—Aurelius—I am thine now—all thine!”
and, as the horror-stricken Hun released his hold
upon her arm, she darted forward, and threw herself
upon the bosom of her brave lord. Convulsively, in
the death spasm, his arms closed about her,</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>A man</span> was lying at the further end of a dismal
cell, in the prison of Versailles, when one of the
jailors, thrusting a huge key into the lock of a small
but massive door, roused him with the unwelcome
salutation, “come, get up—the time is come, and
the gentlemen are waiting for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, already!” replied the unhappy wretch to
whom these words were addressed, and stretching
his muscular limbs, he added, “what a pity, I was
so sound asleep!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rose, shook the bits of straw from his hair and
beard, and putting on the remains of an old hat,
which had once been white, calmly said, “well, I
am ready—the sooner it is over the better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The executioner, who was waiting with one of his
assistants in the outer vestibule of the prison, threw
an oblique glance upon the prisoner, then, looking at
his watch, exclaimed, “come, make haste! we are
already after our time—the market is nearly over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but you have not far to go,” replied the turnkey;
then addressing the prisoner—“old one,” said
he, “it will soon be over, and the weather is fine.
Here, take this, it will keep up your spirits.” And
he handed him a glass of brandy, which the prisoner
drank off with evident delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, good master,” he replied, returning the
glass to the good natured turnkey, “I shall never
forget your kindness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well,” said the latter, “that is settled.
Never mind what I do for you, man—it is little
enough, God knows—only behave well—dost hear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The executioner’s man drew from his pocket a
long and strong cord, with a slip knot at the end, and
tightly tied the hands of the convict, who calmly
looked at him, and said not a word. The executioner
himself carried a board, on which was a sort of
notice, partly printed and partly written; and all
three proceeded slowly towards the market place,
where the prisoner was to be placed in the pillory
for one hour, and exposed to the gibes and taunts of
an almost ferocious populace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the scaffold to which he was fastened, the
old mendicant cast a look of pity upon the crowd,
and said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, and what are you looking at? am I an
object of such intense curiosity? But you are right;
look at me well, for you shall never more behold me.
I shall not return from the place to which they are
going to take me—not that I fear a dungeon, for I
have been too long accustomed to have no other bed
than the cold ground. No, I shall return hither no
more; and I should have done well had I not returned
this time. But I could not help it. I was born
here, though I never told any body so; and I love
the spot where I first drew breath. ’Tis natural
enough; yet why should I love it? I never knew
either home or parents—the latter left me, when an
infant, upon the steps of the church of St. Louis.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here the sun-burnt countenance of the old mendicant
assumed an expression of bitterness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who knows,” he continued, “but I may have
among you some uncles or cousins—perhaps even
nearer relatives.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crowd gathered round the scaffold, listening
to the words of the mendicant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And my excellent father,” said the latter, “what
a pity he is not here to own me! Perhaps he would
be delighted at the <span class='it'>elevation</span> to which I have attained.
For my own part, I never had a son; but if I
had, I could not have deserted him. He should
never have been able to reproach me with being the
author of his misery. The other day I was hungry—I
asked for a morsel of bread—everybody refused
to give it me; and that is the reason why I am here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the old man uttered the last sentence, his head
fell upon his chest, and he wept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length the executioner returned, accompanied
by his assistant, who carried upon his shoulders a
furnace, in which was an iron instrument, with a long
wooden handle. Both ascended the scaffold, and
placed themselves behind the mendicant. The crowd
drew nearer. The executioner’s man laid the mendicant’s
shoulder bare, whilst the executioner himself
stooped and took up the instrument. The poor convict
shuddered, uttered a plaintive cry, a light smoke
arose, and the ignominious letter was imprinted
for ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The poor man, scarcely able to stand, was helped
from the scaffold, and conveyed back to his prison
through the crowd, who pressed upon his passage to
glut upon his sufferings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Old Philippe—such was the mendicant’s name,
was well known in the department of Seine and Oise;
but nobody could tell who he was, whence he came,
or who his parents were. About fifteen years previous,
just after the restoration, he had appeared in
the country for the first time. He then asked questions,
and seemed in pursuit of information on secret
matters, of which nobody could penetrate the motive.
After some time, he appeared to suffer much, as if
from disappointment, and then disappeared. About
two years before the period of our narrative, he again
made his appearance at Versailles, very much altered,
and looking much older. Fortune had not smiled
upon him during his absence, for he went away a
poor man, and returned a mendicant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No one knew where he had been, or how he had
lived during this interval. It was supposed, that,
previous to his first appearance at Versailles, he had
travelled a great deal, and even borne arms; for of
late years, whenever he obtained the favor of a
night’s lodging in a barn, he would repay this hospitality
by descriptions of foreign countries, and accounts
of bloody conflicts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the day after his exposure in the pillory, as
above related, the following particulars concerning
him were made known:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>One evening, faint with hunger and fatigue, after
having begged through the environs of Versailles,
without once obtaining alms, and his wallet having
been empty for the two preceding days, he had
stopped at the door of one of those elegant habitations
which overlook the heights of Rocquencourt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He begged a shelter for the night, and a morsel
of bread, but both were refused him, and he was
rudely driven from the door. Leaning upon his
stick, he slowly quitted the inhospitable mansion,
and with difficulty gained a part of the demesne laid
out in the English style of landscape gardening.
Taking shelter under a thick clump of trees, he laid
himself upon the grass, to die with the least possible
pain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The autumn had already begun. The grass was
wet—the wind whistled through the trees, already
in part stripped of their leaves—all around was
pitchy dark, and every thing seemed to announce an
inclement night. Cramped with cold, he felt the
most unconquerable gnawings of hunger. Could he
but sleep, he thought, perhaps the next day might
prove less unfavorable than the two preceding ones.
But sleep refused the call, and the poor mendicant
suffered the most cruel pangs. Unable to bear them
any longer, he rose, took his stick, and returned to
the mansion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had observed an angle of the wall which could
be easily escaladed, and a window badly closed. It
was late, the night was dark, and he might perhaps
find a bit of bread. At least, he determined to try.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The house was inhabited by an old man of more
than eighty—a rich miser, who lived alone, like
many of those who go to spend their last days at
Versailles. He had perceived the mendicant, and
had seen him take refuge under the clump of trees.
He ordered his servants to watch him, and scarcely
had poor Philippe opened the window, when he was
seized, handcuffed, and taken to Versailles, where he
was thrown into prison. There, at least, he found
shelter, and a bit of bread to eat, which the turnkey
gave him from humanity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the expiration of six months, the mendicant
was convicted at the assizes of the department of
Seine et Oise. His sentence was the gallies for
fifteen years, and to be previously exposed and
branded. He had entered a house at night for the
purpose of theft, and with deadly weapons—the
possession of the knife, which he usually carried in
his pocket, and was found there, being thus interpreted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A month had already elapsed since he had been
publicly branded, and poor Philippe seemed patiently
waiting for the time when he was to be sent to
his destination at Toulon. He always said that he
would not go, and the turnkey did not contradict
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One evening a small iron lamp upon a shelf, suspended
from the wall by a cord on each side, threw
a weak and vacillating light upon the gloom of a
cell in the prison of Versailles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon a straw matress, half covered with an old
patched blanket, lay a man apparently overcome
with weakness and despair. His face was turned
towards the wall. An earthen jug without a spout
was near him, and close to it a wooden bowl filled
with soup.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor Philippe will never get over it,” said the
turnkey in the corridor, speaking to some one to
whom he was showing the way. “But it is his own
fault; he would not remain in the infirmary. The
fact is, Monsieur le Curé, ever since he exhibited
upon the <span class='it'>little stage</span>, about a month ago—curse this
lock, it would sprain the wrist of the devil himself—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Peace my friend,” replied a mild voice, “do not
swear—it is an offence against God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door of the prison was at length opened, and
the turnkey ushered in a venerable priest, the chaplain
of the prison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hollo, old one!” cried the jailor, “take heart,
man, here is a visitor. Here is Monsieur le Curé
come to see you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mendicant made no reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My friend,” said the minister of the Gospel, “I
am one of your brethren in Christ, and I bring you
words of peace and consolation. Hear me, in the
name of our Lord Jesus, who died on the cross to
atone for our sins—He suffered more than you; and
it depends upon yourself to be one day happy, and to
dwell with him in eternal life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still the prisoner spoke not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He sleeps,” said the kind-hearted turnkey. “If
your reverence will but wait a moment I will awake
him.” And he shook the mendicant, but in vain—the
latter stirred not. “Oh! oh!” said the jailor,
leaning over him; “but it is all over with him; he
has slipped his wind—the poor fellow’s as dead as
a door post.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, in fact, the unfortunate Philippe had ceased
to live a few moments after he had been removed,
that very morning, at his own request, from the infirmary
to his old cell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is the poor man really dead?” inquired the
priest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dead as a pickled herring, your reverence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And without confession!—unhappy man!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the good priest knelt upon the cold flag stones
and prayed with fervour for the soul of the deceased
mendicant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next day the wealthy owner of the mansion was
reclining in an easy chair, his tortured limbs writhing
with agony on the cushions of down by which
they were supported. His physician in attendance
was seated near him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I find myself worse to-day, doctor: I am weaker
than I have yet been, and I feel something which I
cannot well define.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At your age, my dear sir, and in your state of
health,” the physician replied, “you must seek
amusement for your mind. I have always told you
that solitude is baneful to you. You should send for
some members of your own family, or get some devoted
friend to come and live with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Family! devoted friend! Why, you well know,
doctor, that collaterals are mere heirs; you are in
their way whilst you live: they only wait to prey
upon your soil after your death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But had you never any children?” the doctor
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never,” replied his patient, after some hesitation.
“And I have no relations.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here the unhappy old man sighed, his brow became
clouded, and he seemed to writhe in mental
agony. Suddenly, by an apparent effort, changing
the conversation, and assuming a tone of unconcern—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, doctor,” he said, “and so this scoundrel
of a mendicant, who, you may be assured, wanted
to murder, and afterwards rob me, died yesterday
in the prison hospital.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not in the hospital,” replied the physician.
“I did all I could to induce him to remain in the
infirmary; but he refused, and even solicited, as a
favour, to be taken back to the cell he occupied before
his trial.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see then, doctor, what a villain he was. I
suppose he felt remorse for the crime he intended to
commit in this house. Did he make any avowal?
Is any thing known of his family?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing, except that he was an illegitimate
child, and was found, shortly after his birth, under
the peristyle of St. Louis’ church.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“St. Louis’ church?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes: and he was taken to the Foundling Hospital
in the Rue du Plessis.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Rue du Plessis?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes: he told me the whole story the day before
yesterday, at my evening visit to the prison infirmary.
He had carefully preserved an old card, upon
which were traced some strange characters, and an
engraved stone belonging to a seal. He requested
me to take charge of them. I believe they are still
in my pocket-book. Yes, here they are. This stone
must have belonged to a valuable trinket—he probably
sold the setting. Here is the card.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old invalid, whose increasing agitation had
not been observed by the doctor, threw a rapid glance
over these objects,—then, with a shriek of horror,
sunk back upon his chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great God,” he exclaimed, “the mendicant was
my son!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few minutes after, this unnatural parent had

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY THE “AUTHOR OF CRUIZING IN THE LAST WAR.”</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>BON HOMME RICHARD.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> time sped merrily away in <span class='it'>la belle France</span>,
and months passed, leaving us still in port. In fact,
when our craft came to be surveyed, it was found
that her hull was so rotten, as to make it dangerous
for us to put to sea in her, until she had been thoroughly
overhauled. This occasioned some delay.
Having but little to do, and finding society thrown
freely open to them, the officers spent most of their
time in the interchange of courtesies with their affable
entertainers. There was beside a good number
of French naval officers in the place, and many a
wild meeting took place betwixt our mess and them.
At length, however, I tired of this, and hearing that
Paul Jones was in Paris, I set off for the capital.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That singular individual was, at this time, engaged
in fitting out the <span class='sc'>Bon Homme Richard</span> and her accompanying
squadron, preparatory to a cruise off
the English coasts. He was all enthusiasm as to
the success of the expedition, but found great difficulty
in procuring a fitting crew. He received me
warmly, recognizing me at once, and flatteringly
calling to mind several of the affairs in which I had
been engaged, and my conduct in which he thought
proper to commend. I was gratified by his notice,
and spoke in reply something, I know not what,
respecting his own career. His eye kindled as he
answered—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye! but that is not all—we will make our
name a terror to the whole English coast. Had it
not been for some knavish foes of ours here, who
throw every impediment they can in our way, we
should have done deeds before this at which the
cheeks of his majesty of England would have blanched.
But our time has come. We have the ‘Good-man
Richard,’ a sturdy old Indiaman, for our own
craft, beside the Pallas, a smart ship, the Vengeance
brig, and the Cerf, a cutter of metal. They tell me
the Alliance is to go with me, under the command
of that fellow Landais. So at least Franklin has
said—God help his knowledge of naval warfare!
However,” he continued, with a shrug of his shoulders,
“there is no help for it, and the frigate would
be quite a God-send if it were not for the commander.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I understand you have some difficulty in getting
a crew—is it so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes! And, by the bye, why can’t you join
me? Come, you are the very man I want.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Flattered as I was by this offer, I could not persuade
myself to leave the <span class='sc'>Fire-Fly</span>; beside, as the
officers in the squadron were to take precedence
according to the dates of their commission in the
American service, and as I had always served under
the commonwealth of New York, I foresaw that my
acceptance of this offer would either place me under
those who were really my juniors in service, or else
occasion jealousies among the parties I should supplant.
Moreover, I knew not what might be the
eventual determination respecting my craft, and I
felt unwilling, in case she should again go to sea, to
desert her. I stated my objections frankly to the
commodore. He hesitated a moment, and then replied,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe you are right. Yet I am sorry I cannot
have you. We sail in a week from L’Orient.
Come, at least, and see us off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I accepted his invitation, and it was with a heavy
heart I saw them put to sea. By the end of the
month, however, I heard at Paris that the squadron
had returned to the roads at Groix, and that difficulties
had already occurred between the commodore
and Landais. I hurried down at once to L’Orient,
and found both the Richard and Alliance undergoing
repairs. The commodore gladly received me, and
renewed again his offer, telling me that he had heard
that my craft was to be dismantled; and, sure
enough, that afternoon I received a letter from my
captain, informing me that the schooner had been
found unworthy of repair, and been condemned.
There was now nothing to detain me, except the
difficulty respecting my rank in the squadron. This
I soon removed by going as a volunteer. I accordingly
wrote to my captain, obtained leave of absence,
and on the 14th of August, 1779, went with
my traps on board the Bon Homme Richard. The
same day we put to sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The events of that extraordinary cruise are matter
of history, and I need not dwell on them at length
in this hurried autobiography. We soon parted company
with our consorts, and were forced to seek
them at the rendezvous; but, during the whole voyage,
our plans were continually frustrated by occurrences
of this character, sometimes accidental, and sometimes,
I believe, designed, especially on the part of
Captain Landais. After taking three or four prizes,
we bore up for the north of Scotland, when having
been at sea about a month, we made the Cheviot
Hills, vast blue landmarks, lying, like a thunder-cloud,
along the western horizon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Learning that two or three armed cutters, together
with a twenty gun ship, were lying off Leith, the
commodore planned a descent on that place; but in
consequence of the absence of the Alliance, was
forced to delay his project for several days. At
length we beat into the Frith of Forth; and when
just out of gun-shot of the town, the boats were ordered
out and manned. But at this critical moment
a squall struck our squadron, and we soon had
enough on our hands, for the puff settling down into
a regular North Sea gale, we had to fill away, and
bear up under a press of canvass for an offing. The
storm lasted so long that we were forced to give
over our attempt, as the country had now become
alarmed, and beacon lights, to rouse the yeomanry,
were burning on every headland. We bore away,
therefore, for the south.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had kept on this course for several days, until
one calm evening, off Flamborough head, when, the
sea being nearly as smooth as a lake, and a light
southwardly wind dallying playfully with our sails,
we discerned the headmost vessels of a fleet of
merchant ships, stretching out on a bowline from
behind the promontory. Every man of us was instantly
on the <span class='it'>qui vive</span>. The commodore’s eye kindled,
and he shouted,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Signal the squadron for a general chase.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye! aye!” answered the signal officer, and the
next moment the order was passed through our fleet.
It had scarcely been done, however, before the merchant
ships hurriedly tacked, fired alarm-guns, let
fly their top-gallant sheets, and, huddling together
like a flock of frightened partridges, went off to leeward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a frigate in yonder, convoying, with a
smaller man-of-war,” hailed the look-out, as the
hostile ships shewed their head-sails around the promontory.
“They haul up, sir, and are coming out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let them come,” said the commodore enthusiastically,
“and we’ll have them for our own before
midnight. Shew the signal to form a line—cross
royal-yards—keep boldly on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There goes the Alliance,” said the first lieutenant,
at my side, “see how gallantly she passes the
Pallas—but in God’s name what does she mean?
Surely she is not flying.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Curses on the craven Landais,” muttered Paul
Jones betwixt his teeth, as he saw his consort haul
suddenly off from the enemy, and then turning to
the helmsman, he thundered, “keep her on her
course—steady, steady.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile the crew had been ordered to quarters,
and the tap of the drum brought every man to his
station at once. Unmoved by the cowardice of our
consort, the men appeared to long for the unequal
conflict as eagerly as their daring commander.
Silently they stood at the guns, awaiting the order
to open their fire, and endeavouring to pierce through
the fast gathering gloom, in order to detect the manœuvres
of the foe. Paul Jones stood on the quarter
deck watching the enemy with a night-glass. As we
drew nearer, we detected, in our antagonists, a frigate
of fifty guns, attended by a twenty gun ship a
little to leeward. The sight would have appalled
any hearts but those on board our daring craft,—for
our armament, all told, did not exceed forty-two
guns, only six of which were eighteens; while, from
the lower gun deck of the frigate alone, might be
seen frowning through her lighted ports, a battery
of ten eighteens to a side. Yet not an eye quailed,
not a cheek blanched, as we drew up towards the
foe; but each man stood calmly at his post, confident
in his leader and in the righteousness of his cause.
My own station was near the commodore. We were
now near enough to hail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What ship is that?” came slowly sailing on the
night wind, from a dark form on the quarter of the
frigate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shall soon know,” answered Paul Jones, and
on the instant the word was given simultaneously
by both commanders to fire, and the two ships poured
in their batteries with scarcely the delay of an instant
betwixt the broadsides. I had no time to observe
the effect of our discharge, for scarcely had
the commodore spoken, when I heard a tremendous
explosion in the direction of our gun-room; the deck
above it was blown bodily up, and as the smoke
swept away from the spot, I beheld two of the eighteens
shattered and dismounted, and surrounded by
a crowd of wretches, maimed and dying from the
accident. I rushed to the place, and a more awful
sight never before or since have I beheld. There
lay our poor fellows, dismembered and bleeding,
groaning in agony such as no pen can picture, and
crying aloud, with their dying breath, for “water—water—water.”
Here one, horribly mangled, hung
over a gun that had burst—there another was
stretched on the deck, with no marks on him except
a black spot by the eye, from which the blood was
trickling slowly. I shuddered and turned away. It
would have been madness to have attempted to work
the other eighteens, so the men were called away,
and we began anew the action, with our chances
one-third lessened by this horrible calamity. But
the death of their messmates fired the rest of the
crew with a thirst for revenge, which soon told in
the murderous fire we poured in upon the enemy.
For nearly an hour we kept up the conflict, working
our lighter guns with the utmost vigor, and attempting
to manœuvre so as to rake the enemy, but at
every new endeavor we were foiled by the superior
working qualities of our opponent. Meantime the
moon had risen, and we could see that the Pallas had
got alongside of the enemy’s consort, and was gallantly
engaged yard-arm to yard-arm with her—the
Alliance hovering out of range in the distance, and
occasionally discharging a random broadside which
did no execution. How our brave fellows cursed the
cowardice of her captain!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay! there she is,” said one, “afraid to come
within range even of a twenty gun ship, lest the lace
of her coxcomb captain’s uniform might be ruffled.
But never mind—we’ll win the battle without her—bowse
away, my hearties, and give it to the
Englisher with a will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile the enemy’s frigate doggedly kept her
luff, and her masts were now seen, for the hull was
completely shrouded in a thick canopy of smoke,
shooting ahead, as if it was her intention to pay
broad off across our forefoot. Paul Jones saw the
manœuvre, and determined to avail himself of it to
run afoul of his antagonist; for, with our vast inferiority
of metal, there was not the remotest chance
of success in a regular combat. The attempt, however,
was in itself almost as desperate; but it afforded
a hope, though a slight one, of victory. Whatever
might be the fate of this daring proceeding,
however, we were all actuated by but one impulse,
and that was, a determination to conquer or die.
When, therefore, the frigate forged ahead, we kept
our sails trimmed and bore steadily on. The result
was as we had expected. Finding that she could not
effect her purpose, the frigate put her helm hard
down, making a desperate attempt to clear us. It
was in vain. With a crash that shook both vessels
to their centre, we ran aboard of the foe, bows on, a
little on her weather quarter. With chagrin, we
saw that it was impossible to board our antagonist—an
intention so well understood among our men, that
they had ceased firing on the moment. At this instant
the smoke swept partially away, and the
English captain was seen near the mizen rigging,
shouting to know whether we had struck. The inquiry
brought the red blood in volumes into the face
of Paul Jones, as he thundered hoarsely,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have not yet begun to fight;” and then turning
to his men, he said, “out with your guns and have
at them. Will you, by your silence, be thought to
have surrendered?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never,” answered back the captain of a gun
before him; “Huzza for the brave thirteen—down
with the tyrants—give it to ’em one and all—huzza.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An answering shout rose up from the crew, the
guns that could be brought to bear were jerked out,
and simultaneously the whole of our forward larboard
side was a sheet of flame, while the old craft
trembled from kelson to cross-trees, and heeled
back with the recoil, till the yard-arms almost
touched the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brace back the yards,” shouted the commodore,
as soon as his voice could be heard above the din,
and obedient to the press of the wind, our vessel fell
slowly astern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are laying aback their forward, and shivering
their after sails, on board the frigate,” said
Dale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Box-hauling her, by St. Andrew,” said the commodore;
“the knaves are for luffing up athwart our
bows, in order to rake us. But it takes two to play
at that game—we’ll drop astern a little more, fill
on the opposite tack, and luff up against her as she
comes to the wind. Let us once lay her athwart
hawse, and the battle’s won.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rapidly and steadily our daring leader gave his
orders to execute this manœuvre, but the smoke had
settled down so thick around us, shrouding the moon
almost entirely from sight, that we could only now
and then catch a glimpse of the approaching enemy,
and miscalculating our distance, instead of meeting
her as we had expected, we were run into by the
frigate, her bowsprit crashing over our high towerlike
poop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Parker,” said Paul Jones, quickly, “get some
lashings and help me to fasten her head-gear to the
mizzen mast. That’s it—we have her now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, and the frigate feels the strain already,”
said I, as we finished our hasty work; “see how she
swings around by our side—something has given
way on board of her, by that crash.”<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re right, but lash fast yonder anchor that’s
hooked in our quarter—we’ll not let them escape
now—but yonder come their fellows as if to board
us. Boarders ahoy! beat back the villains,” and
springing from my side, our ever ready leader, himself
led the party to repulse the foe. I followed.
Dark masses of seamen, clustered on the sides of the
frigate, were endeavoring to effect an entrance on
our deck; thrusting with their long pikes, cutting
and slashing with their cutlasses, and cheering each
other on to the attack, with shouts and imprecations.
For an instant, our crew, fearfully outnumbered,
seemed to waver; but at this moment Paul Jones
leaped into the midst of the fray, and, with one stroke
of his weapon bringing a foe to the deck, shouted,
“Down with the miscreants—strike home one
and all—bravely my lads,” and accompanying each
word with a blow, he cleared a space before him in
less time than I have taken to narrate the event.
For an instant the enemy faltered, but a huge boatswain
the next moment rallied them, and aiming a
pistol at Paul Jones, the fellow shouted,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hurl the pirates to perdition—come on, hearts
of oak—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was luckily by, and as the villain spoke, I
struck up his arm, and his ball glanced harmlessly
over the Commodore’s head. The boatswain did not
live to take vengeance on me for my interposition—he
did not even survive to finish his sentence; for
scarcely had the words left his mouth, before Paul
Jones drove his boarding pike deep into the Englishman’s
heart. There was a dull gurgling sound, as
he fell back without a groan, dropped heavily to the
water, and sank like lead. His companions were
aghast, and struck with a sudden panic, retreated.
The next moment not one was left attempting to
board.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the last few minutes, my attention had
been so occupied by the sharp conflict, in which I
was personally engaged with the boarders, that I had
lost sight altogether of the general battle; and I now
cast a hurried glance around to see what other advantages,
if any, we had gained over the enemy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sight that met my eye, almost blanched my
cheek with apprehension. Crowds of our men from
the main deck were hurrying up the gangways, and
the thought instantly flashed across my mind that
they had mutinied. The guns, too, below, were all
silenced, and only three or four twelves, with a
couple of pieces on the quarter deck, were being
worked; while the fire of the enemy was still kept
up with unremitting fury. At this juncture, a midshipman
from the main deck passed me hurriedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I caught him by the arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In God’s name,” I said, “what is the matter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are ripping us to pieces below, with their
cursed eighteens,” was the hurried response. “We
kept it up as long as we could, often thrusting our
rammers into their ports, as we loaded, so close were
we to them. But it’s no use. They’re beating in
our timbers as if our good stout oak was no better
than pasteboard. I am taking my men forward and
aloft, it is sheer murder to keep them below; they
must fight now with muskets and hand grenades,”
and hurrying breathlessly away, he was the next
instant engaged in directing his men with an energy
only second to that of the Commodore, and which
seemed to have diffused itself amongst all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The combat, which had paused a moment, now
raged again with redoubled fury. Crowding into the
tops, and thronging on the forecastle, our brave
fellows kept up such a galling contest, with musketry
and grenades, that, in less than five minutes, every
man of the enemy was driven below, and his quarter
deck was left tenanted only by the dead. But fearfully
did the foe return our fire from his heavy guns
on the main deck. Broadside after broadside was
poured into us without intermission—the old craft
quivering like wounded flesh, at every discharge,
until it seemed as if each successive fire would end
the contest, by sending us to the bottom. Yet our
men never flinched. No cry for quarter, no murmur
even, was heard. Manfully they stuck to their new
posts, keeping up their deadly warfare through the
ports of the foe, and though now and then an eye was
turned around the horizon, to see whether the Alliance
was not coming to our aid, not a man displayed
any signs of fear. One of our fellows, even bolder
than the rest, provided with a bucket of grenades and
a match, lay out on the yard, and coolly dropped his
combustibles on the deck of the frigate. One he
threw with such precision, that it went down the
main hatchway. In an instant a slight explosion
took place, and we could hear, notwithstanding the
uproar of the guns, a whizzing sound running aft
on board the enemy—while almost simultaneously,
the most thrilling shrieks of anguish rose up on the
air, succeeded by a stunning explosion, which drowned
every other sound in its fierce uproar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Their loose cartridges must have been fired,”
I exclaimed, “God help the poor wretches.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The day’s our own—huzza!” sung out a warrant
officer beside me, “but, in the name of heaven,” he
said suddenly, “what means the Alliance?—she is
firing into us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I looked to windward, and no words can express
my astonishment, when I saw, in the hazy distance,
the ship which ought to have been engaged at our
side with the foe, now heading to the westward, and
firing hotly in our direction, at the very moment that
she was crossing our larboard quarter, and when her
shot could not reach the foe without passing directly
through us. The discharge, indeed, dismounted two
of our guns, beside damaging us aloft. She was by
this time nearing us fast, and directly abeam.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re firing into a friend,” shouted fifty voices
in a breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does he mean?” said Dale, “surely he
can see that we haven’t yellow sides like the foe—shew
him the signal of recognition.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The three lanterns, in a line, were instantly let
down on the off side, when the Alliance ceased
firing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lay the enemy aboard,” shouted the officer of
the deck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No answer was returned, and our consort kept
coolly on her course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you hear the order?” thundered the now
exasperated commodore; “lay the enemy aboard, I
say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, ay, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perdition take the cowardly traitor,” muttered
Paul Jones betwixt his teeth, as he turned from the
recreant ship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I watched, however, the course of the frigate until
she had hauled off some distance, and was almost
lost in the shadowy gloom to larboard, when suddenly
a cry of “fire” startled me, and turning hastily
around I saw that the lower deck was a mass of flame.
The confusion, for a moment, baffled description.
Men were hastening to and fro for buckets; some
shouted one thing and some another; a general consternation
seemed to be spreading among the crew,
and all discipline, for an interval of several minutes,
was lost. To add to the disorder, the ship was perceptibly
settling, and a rumour spread through the
decks that we would sink in less than ten minutes.
While everything was still plunged in chaos, the
Alliance again appeared, edging down on our larboard
beam, and hauling up athwart our bows, she
poured in a fire of grape, which took effect on our
crowded forecastle, instead of on the enemy—if indeed
it was ever intended for the foe—and killed
several of our own men. Never shall I forget the
fate of one of our best officers—poor Creswell! who
fell a victim to this discharge. I held his head in
his last moments, and with his eye already glazing
in death, and his tongue faltering in its accents, he
prayed God to forgive his countrymen for his wanton
murder. My blood boiled with indignation against
the scoundrel who commanded the gallant Alliance,
and, at that moment, I would have given ten years
of my life to have crossed swords with Landais.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I had no time for thoughts of revenge. Louder
and louder swelled the cry ‘that we were sinking,’
and, as I laid the dead man’s head on the deck, I
saw the carpenter hurry to the commodore with consternation
depicted on every feature of his face.
Instantly the cry arose, that he had sounded the
pump-wells, and that all was over. The wildest
confusion followed. More than a hundred of our
prisoners were let loose by the master-at-arms, who
imagined that all was over, and in a few minutes the
deck was crowded with them. Had they then known
their power, we should have been overpowered with
ease, and, as I looked on their fierce faces, I trembled
for the first time. To add to all, the gunner rushed,
at this crisis, on deck, and not perceiving the commodore
or the lieutenant, would have hauled down
our flag, and failing in this—for the staff had been
shot away—he cried out for quarter. Another
second would have decided our fate, but springing
aft, I shouted that we had not surrendered, and, at the
same instant, the commodore re-appeared, and confirming
my assertion, rallied his men hastily around
him, and led them to repel a party of boarders, which
taking advantage of our disorder, was, at this moment,
clustering on our gunwale. The conflict here
was short, but decisive. Fired anew by the words
and example of their commodore, our brave fellows
redeemed their momentary vacillation, and, aided by
the men in the tops, hurled back the foemen, as if
an avalanche had struck them, on the decks of their
frigate. Meantime, the first lieutenant, availing
himself of the fears of the prisoners, had mustered
them at the pumps, and, arming another party with
buckets, had succeeded in extinguishing the fire.
The re-action, on the part of our crew, was decisive.
The men now fought with a fury that nothing could
suppress, for they knew over what a mine they hung,
and that victory must be soon theirs, or they would
lose all. Several guns were dragged over to the side
against the foe, and the fire of our battery re-commenced
with treble vigor. The top-men hailed down
grenades on the frigate’s decks, and deafening volleys
of musketry incessantly rattled from our forecastle.
The enemy could hold out no longer. A
man darted up the frigate’s hatchway, dashed aft,
and the next moment the cross of Britain was at our
feet. A cheer, that shook the very welkin, and
which, dying away, was renewed and renewed again,
burst from our brave tars, and rolling down to leeward
announced our hard bought victory.</p>

<div><h1><a id='spor'></a>Sports and Pastimes.—THE FOWLING-PIECE.</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>A book</span> presents to the shot an elastic body, like down,
through which large shot does not penetrate much farther
than small, because it has to displace and carry
with it a larger mass of paper. Fur and feathers of
game do not present such a resisting body to the shot as
the leaves of a book do; therefore, although large shot
will bear the above test, a much fairer way of trying it
would be to fire at thin pieces of wood fixed upright, (a pile
of cigar boxes would answer the purpose). The latter trial
would, we think, convince any one of the great difference in
momentum between the two charges. At forty yards, not
more than three No. 7 pellets could be calculated on to
strike a partridge, and those from a light gun would necessarily
be weak; whereas, at that distance, with our charge,
two No. 2 pellets might be calculated upon, and with what
effect we leave the experimentalist to decide, when he has
tried it at a target composed of pieces of wood one eighth,
one third, and one half of an inch thick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not so much the velocity as the momentum of a shot
that renders it effective. The momentum of a shot increases
in a direct ratio with its weight. The momentum of a No.
2 shot much more than compensates for the diminished
weight of powder and additional weight of lead that we have
recommended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The structure of a bird or quadruped not protected by
feathers or fur—and we contend that game is very slightly
so protected as against shot—may be compared with that of
a ship. It is a well ascertained fact that a 64 lb. ball, moving
with only half the velocity of a 32 lb. ball, would produce
more than double the effect; the larger, but slowly-flying
ball, would split a much thicker mast or beam, and do more
damage to the frame-work of a ship, than the small one.
Upon the same principle, we think large shot is more effective
for shooting the stronger species of game.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But assuming that game is right well fortified with a
covering of fur, feathers or down, that circumstance would
not induce us to resort to small shot; quite the reverse, because
we know that small shot cannot be fired through down
effectively from a large gun at thirty yards, much less from
a light fowling-piece. No stanchion-gun will shoot No. 7
effectively at ducks, geese, and the larger wild-fowl—the
birds killed would be chiefly such as were struck in the head;
not one would be stopped by a body blow. Yet large shot
from the stanchion-gun, after passing through down, strikes
an effective body blow. No doubt No. 7 may be shot
through down, but after overcoming the resistance, it would
scarcely injure the bird, certainly not break a bone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus we find that small shot, fired from any gun, is totally
inadequate to kill birds protected with down by a body
blow; but that large shot, flying from a large gun with not
half the velocity of the ineffectual small shot, achieves what
is desired. It is the momentum that effects the object.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A collateral advantage arising from the use of large shot
should not be overlooked. In order to kill in good style
with small shot, the aim must be such that the bird fired at
shall be near the centre of the charge as thrown; for if the
bird be near the outer circle of the charge, it is ten to one
that it is only slightly wounded; but if near the outer circle
of a charge of large shot, it is ten to one that it is brought
down; for it must not be lost sight of, that when large shot is
used, a single pellet will mostly be sufficient to bring a bird
down. There is a stunning effect produced by large shot,
which throws the bird off its balance at once. Small shot
has not the same <span class='it'>immediate</span> effect. Hares, rabbits, grouse,
pheasants, and full-grown partridges, will carry it off,
though they fall within a hundred yards. It is very seldom,
indeed, that a bird towers after being fired at with large shot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The term friction implies a gradual contraction of the
barrel towards the muzzle, which retards the progress of
the shot, that more time may be allowed to the powder to
burn. Relief accelerates the progress of shot through the
barrels. What is the proper degree of relief or friction for
different descriptions of barrels, is a subject fruitful of controversy;
as is also the form of the breech. The best
breech is that which will cause the greatest quantity of
powder to consume in the barrel, and give the least recoil.
The percussion system of firing has simplified the boring of
guns. We think that short barrels intended to be fired by
percussion, should be bored perfect cylinders, and the
breech should be conical or nearly so, and capable of holding
a little more than half a charge of powder. Long barrels
should be bored true cylinders throughout the greater part
of their length, a little relief being allowed near the muzzle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A barrel, which recoils from being light, or from not
being held firmly when fired, throws shot very weakly. So,
on the other hand, barrels which have sufficient weight to
break the recoil, or which are placed against something
solid when fired, have their shooting power amazingly increased.
The reason is, that when the gun is allowed to
recoil, a portion of that power which should be employed in
expelling the shot is uselessly expended on a yielding surface
in a contrary direction: whereas, when the barrel is
firmly fixed, or is of sufficient weight to break the recoil,
that portion of the explosive force which strikes against the
breech rebounds and is forced back upon the shot, and consequently
becomes a portion of the available strength of the
charge. This explains why the weight of the gun rather
than a difference in length or bore regulates the shooting
power. In what follows, Mr. Greener,<a id='r3'/><a href='#f3' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[3]</span></sup></a> whose book contains
a lucid exposition of the nature of projectile force, shows
this more clearly:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The fact that the shooting powers of a gun are increased
by its being fixed in an immoveable frame, is proved with
the practice of mortars. Mortars on iron beds, and these
firmly embedded in the earth, will throw a shell farther
when on the ground than when placed on a platform, or on
board a ship. It is for the purpose of destroying the recoil,
that mortars for sea service, though of the same calibre as
those intended for land-service, are made three times the
weight. Dr. Hutton states, that he found no advantage by
retarding the recoil in practice with artillery. He means,
that no advantage is gained by stopping at three feet a gun
accustomed to recoil to the distance of six. The statement
is perfectly true. If he were to allow a gun to recoil only
an inch, and then to strike against a solid substance, he
would gain nothing. For if it recoil ever so little, the shooting
force is as much weakened as if it recoiled twice as far.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To increase that force, a steady fixed resistance is required.
The velocity of the projectile depends on the force
of the immediate impulse. Before a gun, suffered to recoil,
could rebound from striking some solid substance in its
recoil, the charge would be gone, and could, therefore, receive
no additional impetus from that rebound. The truth
of this fact may be illustrated by throwing a hand-ball
against any loose body with sufficient force to displace it.
However hard or elastic that body might be, the ball would
not rebound from it, but would fall perpendicularly down.
Fix and secure that same body, and then the ball will
rebound with little less force than that with which it was
thrown against it. So it is with gunpowder. If it meet with
a firm resistance, it will rebound and project the ball or shot
with additional force.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>WOODCOCK SHOOTING.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>There is a proverb current among sportsmen, that to kill
a woodcock is to perform a day’s work, which doubtlessly
originated in the circumstance of a woodcock being seldom
found until a large extent of wood has been closely beaten.
When, however, woodcocks are most abundant, it would not
be a difficult task, according to that standard of labor, to do
the work of a week in a day, in any noted cover; for every
cover frequented by cocks acquires a notoriety which it seldom
loses, since any wood well frequented with cocks one
year, has generally a fair supply the next. But whether the
same cocks that frequent a wood this year return the next,
with their offspring, or whether an entirely new set of occupants
take possession, we leave the ornithologist to decide.
A certain description of woods are seldom known to fail of
woodcocks during the winter months; these woods or plantations
are such as are swampy, or have a stream of water
running through them, or woods abounding in springs—or
where, from the nature of the ground, or want of draining,
the top water encourages the growth of moss. The woodcock
is rarely found in woods where moss is not abundant.
During a frost, cocks are found near fresh water springs; at
other times they are most commonly flushed in the open
glades of the densest woods, or rather in those parts of the
woods not choked up at the bottom with fern, rushes, or
brambles, but where they can freely run about, and in those
parts where willows, oziers, hazel-trees, or crate-wood is
plentiful. In such places it will readily be ascertained
whether there are cocks or not, by the borings in the moss
or dead leaves, and by the chalkings. A cock will often be
found near its feeding place, after a dark night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A cock will seldom fly far until it has been fired at several
times: it should, therefore, when practicable, be marked
down. By a judicious system of marking, many successive
shots may be obtained at the same bird. It is seldom that
the skilful shooter flushes a cock, which, with the aid of
markers, he does not eventually kill. The difficulty of
woodcock shooting arises, for the most part, from the birds
being flushed in the thickest part of woods, and contriving
to wing their flight through the trees in such a manner as
to baffle the sportsman’s aim. After being fired at in a
wood, cocks will frequently alight amongst hedge-rows on
the outskirts, especially under a hedge running close to and
parallel with a water-course, when they are easily killed, as
they will not rise until the shooter is close upon them;
and their flight is not difficult to master when there are no
trees to obstruct the aim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A shooter, who has not opportunities of grouse-shooting,
deems cock-shooting the perfection of his art; but he considers
himself more than repaid for his toil, if he bag a
couple or two. Combined with pheasant shooting, it is
glorious sport.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As cocks are birds of passage, and their tarriance in our
covers is of uncertain duration, permission to shoot them is
often given to persons whose honour can be depended upon
not to kill pheasants. To any but a real sportsman this is
a tantalizing employment; the pheasants rise before him
every fifty yards, and he may perhaps not meet with more
than a couple of cocks in a day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Spaniels are the best dogs for this sport: they give tongue
when close upon game, and so allow the shooter notice, in
a situation where he could not see a pointer or setter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Formerly any one who was an adept at bringing down a
woodcock, was certain of the enjoyment of a considerable
local reputation as a shot, and he deserved it. Place one of
their long, heavy, single-barrelled pieces, furnished with an
ancient lock, flint of course, in the hands of a modern shooter,
let him charge with powder similar to that used in the early
days, and take his chance in a tangled brake, where the
cock can make play among the branches for its life, and he
will readily believe that killing a cock in those days was a
real trial of skill. A short light detonator is thrown upon
the bird, the trigger is drawn, and the shot reaches the mark
in an instant; so speedy is the whole process, that it is
scarcely necessary to make any allowance for the motion of
the object, when attempting snap shots at short distances;
but, with the fowling-piece and ammunition of the period
we are speaking of, it was necessary to take aim half a yard
above or before the object moving, for a bird would fly that
distance at least, after the trigger was drawn, and before the
shot reached it; or if it made a sudden turn, the shot swept
past it. Besides the less chance of killing with one of those
long heavy guns, the shooter would not fire half so often as
with a light one; so much more time being necessary to
bring up the piece and calculate the requisite allowance,
the bird would generally be behind the next tree before the
gun would be at the shoulder. Such was the slowness of
ignition, that wild-fowl would take alarm at the flash from
the pan, and dive out of harm’s way ere the shot reached
the water. In all shooting, whether in the open or in cover,
a deal depends upon where the shooter places himself,—a
knowledge of this part of his art will enable him to obtain
twice as many fair shots as his uninitiated companion.
When shooting in high covers, the sportsman should push
on hastily through those parts where, though very likely
for game, he cannot command a view of it should it rise;
but whenever he comes to a glade that commands a view
in several directions, he should wait some time while his
dogs beat around him, and his companions, buried in brambles
and brushwood, pass him. It is often advisable to follow
a footpath in a wood, particularly where ground shots
are expected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In our next, we shall pursue this subject, and give some
remarks upon the lock, the percussion system, triggers,
wadding, ammunition, etc., and shall then proceed with remarks
upon Snipe Shooting, etc. We are determined to
make this department a perfect <span class='it'>vade mecum</span> to the sportsman.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The Life and Times of Red Jacket, or Sa-go-ye-wat-ha;
being a sequel to the History of the Six Nations. By</span>
<span class='sc'>William L. Stone</span>. <span class='it'>1 vol. Wiley and Putnam, New
York and London, 1841.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The first settlers of this country found it tenanted by a
people totally different from the effeminate races of Hispaniola
and Cuba. Bold, patient and sagacious; sinewy in
form and inured to fatigues; warlike in character, wise in
council, and hospitable to a proverb, the savages of North
America approached more nearly to an equality with the
Anglo-Saxon race, than any people whom the rage for discovery
had then made known to Europe. Nor was their
progress in civilization to be despised. Their wigwams,
though not luxurious, were comfortable; their women cultivated
maize, tobacco, and numerous vegetables; pillows of
wood were used in common by them and by the English
peasantry; and, in the comforts of every day life, the savages
of this continent fell little behind the mass of the European
population. Women were held in high respect; their persons
never violated in war, and their opinions consulted in
cases of difficulty. The form of government in use among
the Indians was singularly adapted to their condition. Like
the ancient Germanic leader, the Indian chief was usually
chosen for his wisdom, strength, and bravery—we say
<span class='it'>usually</span>, because in nothing has more ignorance been shown
than in describing the Indian polity as everywhere the same.
No general rule can be laid down respecting it. In most of
the tribes the government was that of a democracy; in some
that of an aristocracy; and, in a few instances, that of a
nearly absolute despotism. Sometimes there was one chief
in war and another in peace: now he was ruled by a council
of old men, and now he had delegated powers equal to
those of a dictator; but, on the whole, the usual polity appears
to have been democratic, each brave having a chance
of attaining the leadership by his eloquence, wisdom, or
courage. Often these qualities preserved the supreme
power in a family for generations, the son succeeding the
father, unless a more worthy leader was chosen by the
people. Where there was both a war chief and a civil
ruler, the latter office was the more likely to be hereditary.
In short, what Tacitus said of the ancient Germans, may be
pronounced of the Indians: “<span class='it'>Reges ex nobilitate, duces ex
virtute sumunt: nec regibus infinita, nec libera potestas;
et duces exemplo potius quam imperio præsunt</span>.” “They
took their kings on account of nobility, and their generals on
account of valor: nor was the power of their kings absolute
and unlimited; and their generals commanded by the authority
which their example rather than their power gave
them.” And, in another place, “<span class='it'>de minoribus principes;
de majoribus omnes</span>”—“the principal men consulted and
decided about the least, the whole body of the people about
the greatest affairs.” Nor did the resemblance stop here.
The same forest life, the same habit of recounting their deeds
in chaunts, the same warlike character, the same wild and
yet spiritual religion, and the same haughtiness of spirit,
arising from the consciousness of independence, characterised
alike our Teuton ancestors, whose freedom we inherit,
and our predecessors on this continent, whose liberty we
have destroyed. And to this day, if we may credit Catlin,
the Western Indian remains the same proud being. The
Sioux, glittering in his showy costume, and careering along
the prairie with his spear and steed, reminds us of the ancient
Pole, flashing with jewels, galloping to the diet at Warsaw,
and seeming to justify the haughty boast of his order, “that
if the sky were to fall they would support it on the points of
their lances.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the period of its settlement by the whites, the two most
powerful nations of what now forms the Northeastern section
of the United States, were the Lenni-Lenape and Mengwe—the
former occupying the shores of the Delaware
river, and extending into Connecticut—and the latter living
chiefly in the Valley of the Mohawk and its vicinity. Neither
of these people were the original occupiers of the land; but
who their predecessors were, or whence they came, no man
can tell. Their language, customs and laws are as unknown
to us as those of the Antediluvian world. They
have passed away and left no sign. Now and then the traveller,
through some primeval forest, will come across the
ruins of their forts—rude, vague and vast—but he can
gather nothing from these silent mounds, except the single
fact, that a race once peopled this continent superior in civilization
to the Indians. The Alligewi gave name to our
mountains,<a id='r5'/><a href='#f5' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[5]</span></sup></a> and that is all we know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Betwixt the Lenni-Lenape and Mengwe there raged continual
wars, in which the former nation generally came off
victorious. At length, however, the several tribes of the
Mengwe united into a confederacy known as that of the Five
Nations; and, being supplied with fire-arms by the Dutch,
succeeded in subduing the Delawares, and forcing them to
assume the character of <span style='font-size:smaller'>WOMEN</span>. This singular ceremony
was performed at Albany, in the presence of the Dutch, in
1617. From that time the Iroquois have been the dominant
nation. A work recording their history, explaining their
governmental polity, and discussing their manners and customs
would throw great light on the whole Indian race, and
prove invaluable to the student; and it is as one of a series,
intended to carry out such an idea, that the present volume
has been published. The author has divided his subject
into four periods: the first of which will contain the history
of the Six Nations, up to the arrival of Sir William Johnson—the
second will be occupied by the life and times of
that remarkable individual—the third carries on the history
through the life of Brandt—and the fourth, the present work,
brings the subject up to the sale of the last Seneca lands in
1838. Only the last two eras of this history have as yet
seen the light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The life of Red Jacket is the least important portion of this
subject, affording little more than a narrative of treaties for
the sale of lands, with an occasional glimpse at the polity of
the Six Nations, and the Senecas in particular. The period
is not one calculated to display the powers which the early
history and origin of the Six Nations might call forth. Industry
and research are nearly all that is required. Both of
these qualities Colonel Stone has evinced. There is little
that is positively new in the book, but many doubtful questions
have been settled, and a clearer insight given into the
Indian character and customs than we had been led to expect.
As an instance of the latter, we notice the fact mentioned of
the women and war-chiefs in the Canandaigua council, who
took the business of the treaty out of the sachems’ hands,
asserting that the latter had no right to refuse the sale of
lands, against the opinion of the women and braves. We
are also made more fully acquainted, in this volume, with
the subjection, in general, of the military to the civil power
among the Indians. Perhaps the style is objectionable in
one or two particulars, and there are too many speeches
given “in extenso;” while events of little importance sometimes
occupy as much space as those of greater moment,
and tend to give an occasional prolixity to the work, which
would be well worth the author’s revision when a second
edition comes to be demanded. The anecdotes which intersperse
the volume are highly characteristic. On the whole,
in collecting and arranging so many undigested facts, and in
preserving from oblivion the oral traditions of the actors in
the scenes he relates, Colonel Stone has shown a commendable
industry. But his work is only begun. The mere record
of a chieftain’s life, however celebrated the individual may
be, is secondary to the history of a mighty people and the
inquiry into its origin. We care little, comparatively, when
or how Red Jacket spoke, but we do care whence his people
came. Our object is to learn the polity and customs of his
nation, to analyze its language—in short, thoroughly to
understand its history and character. To do this is what
constitutes Colonel Stone’s design, but as yet he has only incidentally
carried out his plan. Neither the life of Brandt
nor that of Red Jacket does more than skim over the great
question our author has proposed to discuss. Biography is
not history: the narrative of a few land treaties is not the
account of a nation’s glory. As the greatest people of the
Indian race, and as the conquerors of the Alligewi, we feel
an interest in dissipating the obscurity which attends the
origin of the Six Nations. It is in vain to say such an attempt
would be fruitless. Has it ever been methodically,
analytically, perseveringly tried? Why does Colonel Stone
avoid this portion of his subject—the portion which should
naturally claim his attention first? We tell him frankly
that he would gain ten times more reputation, and prove
himself possessed of ten times more talent, if he would come
up to this matter gallantly, and not scour around and
around it, like a frightened hound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Red Jacket was a sachem or civil chief among the Senecas.
He seems to have been of no family, and to have won his
way to the first place in the councils of his people, by his
tact, his patriotism, and, more than all his eloquence. Few
men have ever lived who surpassed him in oratory, if we
may judge his proficiency in that art by the effect he produced
on his hearers. All that has been related of Demosthenes
and Cicero among the ancients, or of Bolingbroke
and Chatham among the moderns, may be applied with
equal truth to this great orator of the Senecas. When he
rose to speak not a word was heard—when he took his seat
his enthusiasm infected all. He was even able to carry his
point when superstition, in its darkest guise, was arrayed
against him. Some specimens, at least, of such wonderful
powers of eloquence may naturally be expected to have
come down to us; yet, with but one or two exceptions, his
printed speeches are tame to mediocrity. Much of this, no
doubt, is to be attributed to incompetent translations: indeed,
our author lays the whole fault at this door. But there
is another and simpler reason, to which Colonel Stone has not
alluded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every nation has its distinctive spirit, or, to speak more
plainly, its peculiar mode of thought. To this the orator
must accommodate himself. The same style of eloquence
which affects an Englishman, falls cold on the ear of an
Italian. Even the Philippics of Demosthenes, or the orations
of Cicero, were unrivalled, only so far forth as they were
adapted to the peculiarities of an Athenian or Roman audience;
and, had the situation of either of these orators been
changed, there is great chance that, unless they altered their
style, they would have been hooted from the forum, or at
least listened to in silence. So with the oriental orators,
whose most celebrated passages seem turgid to us. We take
it, then, that one of the great secrets of this apparent tameness
in Red Jacket’s orations, arises, as much from our different
appreciation of his style, as from the inadequacy of
the translations. We admit that there exists no perfect
transcript of a harangue by him, but could one of his
speeches be handed down to us, word for word, we predict
that it would seem to us little better than turgid bombast or
inflated allegory. Yet that Red Jacket was a great <span class='it'>Seneca</span>
orator, we have the concurrent testimony of more than fifty
years—to say nothing of the evidence, in the book before
us, of his vigorous intellect and grace of manner, the two
most important requisites for oral eloquence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The character of this celebrated chieftain was an odd mixture
of “dirt and divinity.” He was great as a whole, but
mean in the detail. He ruled over warriors, and was an arrant
coward. He professed to be frank, and lived on intrigue.
His constant struggle was to retain the lands of his
people, and yet more than once he would have sold them for
his personal emolument. He was a hypocrite, a drunkard,
and devoured by vanity; but he was also an orator, a statesman,
and devoted to his country. He sometimes was capable
of the loftiest generosity, and at other times he would
stoop to cheat the government out of a coat. But in one
thing his character is above reproach—he never ceased asserting
the rights of his country; and from the treaty at Canandaigua,
down to the latest hour of his life, he opposed
manfully every alienation of the Seneca soil. He was often
unsuccessful, and always misrepresented; but he did not relax
his efforts. On the size of their domain, he said, depended
the importance of his people; and that people it
was his ambition to preserve an entire nation. For this he
would have built up a wall of separation betwixt them and
the whites—for this he excluded missionaries—for this he
opposed schools—for this he denounced intermarriages—for
this he lived and died a pagan. Yet he survived to see all
his efforts in vain. He survived to behold the Senecas
dwindled to half their numbers, to see their forests cut
down, and to witness their lands slip piecemeal from their
hands. How melancholy to contemplate the poor old chief,
when, returning to hunt in the beautiful valley of the Gennesee,
he found the ravages which the white men had made
in the forest so great, that he sat down and wept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have said that Red Jacket was intemperate; and the
vice grew on him as he grew older. When a council was
to be held, however, he abstained from indulgence until the
deliberations were past, but then his excesses were often
frightful. An anecdote is related by Colonel Stone, which
shows the old chiefs propensity in rather a ludicrous light.
Colonel Snelling was a great favorite with him. When that
officer was given the command of Governor’s Island, Red
Jacket bade him farewell in the following words:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Brother</span>:—I hear you are going to a place called Governor’s
Island. I hope you will be a governor yourself. I
understand that you white people think children a blessing.
I hope you may have a thousand. <span class='it'>And above all, I hope,
wherever you go, you may never find whiskey above two
shillings a quart.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Red Jacket died in 1830, and with him perished the glory
of the once powerful Six Nations. Their subsequent history
is well known. Their last rood of land in New York
has now passed into the hands of the white man; the places
which knew them shall know them no more, and in a few
years the Iroquois will be numbered with the dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The short sketches of the lives of Cornplanter, Farmer’s
Brother, and Harry O’Bail, in the conclusion of the work,
are unusually interesting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The volume is printed well, on paper of the finest quality,
but disfigured, here and there, with typographical mistakes.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The Ancient Régime: A Novel. By</span> <span class='sc'>G. P. R. James</span>, Esq.
<span class='it'>2 vols. Harper and Brothers.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Stale, flat, and unprofitable” are the novels of Mr.
James, and of all his novels the Ancient Régime is the most
flat. We have just flung down the book, wondering how
any man could, “<span class='it'>sanâ mente</span>,” in a sane mind, publish
two volumes so very common-place. Yet Mr. James has
done it, once and again, and yet again, and—God help us—seems
determined to do it, so long as he can find a publisher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We do not say that the novels of James are unreadable,
paradoxical as it may seem, after what we have written. They
are, on the contrary, pleasant, often instructive. In some
respects they are even well written: if they were not so
written, we should pass them in silence; but when a man
of talent persists in writing such common-place affairs as
Corse de Leon and the Ancient Régime, we feel bound to
caution the public against reading them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In reviewing the last novel of this author, we took occasion
to comment on his repetition of himself; and had not
but a bare six months elapsed since the publication of that
article, we should have thought, that he had commenced
this work with our criticism before him; for the whole
conception of the Ancient Régime—according to the preface—is
essentially different from that of Mr. James’ former
romances. To do him justice, he seems to have set
out intending to write something really new. But a dog
that has once tasted blood is forever killing sheep,—and
our novelist, after the first few chapters of the work, runs
into all his old habits. Indeed, had he not told us in set
phrases that his object was to show the gradual changes of
a female mind from infancy to womanhood, and that too
while she was in the peculiar position of a ward of a man
to whom she bore no relationship: had he not told us this—we
say—and added that he had in the Ancient Régime
attempted a new and more gentle style, we should have
divined neither the one fact nor the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is too much <span class='it'>clap-trap</span> in the work before us. Most
novelists are contented if their hero saves the life of his mistress
once in the space of two orthodox volumes. But
James thinks this entirely too little. His heroine seems put
up like a ten-pin, only to be bowled at; for her life is preserved
once from a wolf—once from a robber—and once
from an assassin—and beside this, her honour is kept in
jeopardy, as a kind of running commentary, through the
whole book. We are tempted to say with Titmouse, “ ’Pon
honour—most uncommon luck.” Then, too, everything
happens, not as it would in life, but just as it ought to happen.
Such a chain of fortuitous circumstances, following
each other link by link, we venture to say, author never
imagined, since the old romances of chivalry gave up the
ghost. The deserted babe passes into the very hands to
which it <span class='it'>should</span> go—the supposed father gets a place in
the police, <span class='it'>the very thing for all hands</span>—the young lady
when grown up falls in love with the son of the <span class='it'>only man
living who knows her parentage</span>—the king is frustrated
in meeting Annette, until after Du Barry has given him
<span class='it'>a new object of pursuit</span>—the Baron de Cajore is arrested
at the <span class='it'>very instant</span> he is arresting the hero—Ernest de
Nogent is rescued in the park at Maupay <span class='it'>just as</span> he is
about to be stabbed from behind—and last of all, the assassin
de Cajore is killed off at the end, <span class='it'>in the very nick of
time</span>, and when all the actors are conveniently assembled
to look on, at a nice little tea-party in the forest. Nothing,
indeed, is done naturally: everything is brought about by
luck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the second place, the characters of the Ancient Régime
are only new editions—by no means improved ones—of
the <span class='it'>dramatis personæ</span> of James’ former novels. Some
wicked wag said that the old dramatists wanted only a king,
a fool, a woman, and a villain, to make a tragedy, and Mr.
James seems to have taken up the joke as serious. He is
like a wax-work keeper: he has one figure, which, by dint
of changing the dress, passes for everything under the sun.
His heroes and heroines are never dissimilar: he has always
one noble and one poorer rogue: he never forgets to bring
in a king or a queen, or both; and he fills up the by-play
with a few supernumeraries, who talk a great deal and do
a very little. If you read one of his novels, you read, in
fact, all. Then there are perils, rescues, a duel or two,
generally a trial, and now and then a sprinkling of battles,
ambuscades, and the like. Sometimes the hobby is one
thing and sometimes another, but he never mixes the draught
without putting in a little of all the ingredients. In his last
novel his fancy ran on battles—in this one, trials appear to
rule the roost. To sum up this head, Mr. James seems to
be like a horse in a mill, who, though every time he goes
his rounds, may kick up his heels after a new variety, never
gets out of the same beaten track, or rises above the same
humdrum pace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the third place, there is no ingenuity in the plot of the
Ancient Régime. You see, at once, not only how all is to
end, but you penetrate into every detail of the plot. By the
time you have read thirty pages, you know that Annette is
not Pierre Morin’s daughter—that the Abbé is the unknown
companion of the murderers—that Pierre Morin is the
person who warns Castelneau to leave Paris—and that the
sign which induces the Abbé to obey, is the discovery of
his own seal, which had been lost at the door of Fiteau’s
shop, impressed on the letter of warning. A plot, so loosely
contrived, wants interest; and if you go through the book at
all, it is with labor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But even that very respectable gentleman, who unfortunately
is provided with a tail, is not, according to the popular
rumour, without his good qualities; and Mr. James,
despite all we have said, is yet a writer of talent—talent
running a muck, we contend—but still talent. More than
this—he is a historian; not a mere chronicler, but a historian.
He knows the manners, costume, and general spirit
of the ages of which he writes, and his novels may, so far
forth as they embody this knowledge, be read with interest.
This, too, is the secret of his continued success in despite of
his many faults. This, too, is why he is called the great
historical novelist of the age, though in painting accurately
the characters of his leading personages, such as Richelieu,
Philip Augustus, &amp;c., he is far beneath Grattan—a writer,
by the bye, less known in this country than he deserves to
be. In another thing James is deficient as a writer of historical
romance—he does not enter, as fully as he ought,
into <span class='it'>the spirit of the age</span>. Here Bulwer, in his Rienzi, has
shown himself superior to the author of Richelieu; to say
nothing of Scott, who, whatever license he took with particular
personages, always depicted vividly the spirit of the
age of which he wrote.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We take leave of this novel with a brief prophesy respecting
its author: he will, in fifty years, be of no more note
than any one of the thousand and one <span class='it'>imitators</span> of whose
class he is the head.</p>

numerous engravings. By</span> <span class='sc'>J. Silk Buckingham</span>. <span class='it'>2
vols. Harper and Brothers.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>If ever there was an inane author—if ever there was an
arrant egotist—if ever there was a traveller ignorant of
his subject, that author, egotist, and traveller, is J. Silk
Buckingham, late missionary in the cause of morals, to the
world in general and to this land in particular, and now the
author of a romance which he entitles “America, historical,
statistical, and descriptive.” How could a man suffer himself
to be so egregiously gulled, as Mr. Buckingham has
proved himself to have been, in these volumes? If his lectures
on the Holy Land contained a tithe of the exaggeration
of this journal, what a precious mess of stuff his audiences
must have swallowed!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Buckingham opens with a sweeping condemnation
of all former writers on America, and then adroitly insinuates
that his work is the “<span class='it'>ne plus ultra</span>” of all works. No
one who heard him lecture can doubt his egotism or vanity.
We were not, therefore, much surprised at this exordium.
The text, however, keeps up the farce, and whether describing
the emoluments of the bar, the genius and productions
of our poets, the statistics of the States or Union, the conduct
of political parties, or the advance of taste, morals, or religion,
he is sure to drag in something respecting himself,
and to misrepresent, more or less, the subject under discussion.
Did the book merit the time and space, we would
quote some of its remarks to shew what an arrant block-head,
or else what a wilful libeller, this J. Silk Buckingham
is.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This want of truth in Mr. Buckingham is unpardonable.
While here, he was feasted, huzzaed, followed by crowds, in
short made a lion of,—and, as he himself says, he had
every opportunity to gain correct information. But he
seems to have slighted them all. His exaggerations out-romance
Amadis de Gaul. He is beside painfully dull,
prosing away, page after page, just as he used to dilute his
twaddle, when retailing it, by the hour, at a shilling a head.
His work scarcely lays claim to mediocrity. Although
ushered in by a flourish of trumpets from presses on both
sides of the Atlantic, and attended by a pompous dedication
to His Royal Highness Prince Albert, the volumes are inferior
in every respect to the unpretending work, on this country,
lately published by Mr. Combe. As Brougham said of
Sheridan’s statesmanship, “it is neither a bad book, nor a
good book, nor an indifferent book—the fact is, it is no book
at all.”</p>

of a standard character like this. Let the press second them
in so noble an effort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The object of Schlegel, in this volume, has been to give a
general view of the development and spirit of literature,
and to show its influence on the character of successive
ages, from ancient to modern times. We cannot appreciate,
and cannot therefore be expected to praise, the German
fondness for reducing everything to a theory, and we must
consequently protest against the attempt made by our author
to give his subject such a character. Nevertheless the book
is full of profound reflections, and displays great research.
It is the result of a full mind, and not the idle rhapsody of a
visionary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The present edition is a reprint from the last Edinburgh
one. The translation is attributed to J. G. Lockhart, whose
scholarship is a guarantee for excellence and fidelity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is scarcely equal to Miss Pickering’s earlier production,
“Nan Darrell.” Indeed, the present novel is, by no
means, a work which will increase her reputation. Portions
of it are written well, we admit; but the character of the
book, considered as a whole, is but little above a desperate
mediocrity. There is no individuality in the actors—no
novelty in the plot—many incidents extravagant and unnatural;
and a forced interest, if we may so speak, in the
whole of the second volume. It is true, many of the scenes
are drawn vividly, but they do not suffice to redeem the
work. Worse than all, the introduction of the fugitive,
Charles the Second, together with the whole conception of
the character of the boy Jackson, is a plagiarism from
Woodstock of the worst kind, because one where the spirit
and not the language is stolen. We cannot forgive the
author, even though a woman, for such an act.</p>

<span class='sc'>J. F. Cooper</span>. <span class='it'>2 vols. Lea and Blanchard.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Little can be said of this tale which has not been said
of the former novels, by Mr. Cooper, in which “Leather
Stocking” appears. The story is one of thrilling interest,
full of perils and of hair-breadth escapes. The reader, unable
to lay down the book, peruses it with painful and breathless
eagerness; but, with the exception of Natty Bumpo,
there is no character worthy of the name. Here is the great
difference betwixt Cooper and Scott. No one will deny, that
the former is nearly, if not quite, as successful as the latter
in the interest his story awakens in the reader’s mind, yet
we look back in vain, through the whole series of the Red
Rover tales, for such inimitable characters as those of Balfour
of Burley, and the other actors in the Waverley Novels.
Mr. Cooper paints only the outside, he cannot reach into the
soul. Yet, as an author, skilful in the management of incident,
or capable of whirling away the reader in the breathless
interest of a story, no writer of the day, at least no
American, can, at all, compare with Mr. Cooper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the present tale there is an unusual unity of person,
place and time. The whole action is confined to three days;
the principal characters are not more than six; and the scene
is the lake at Cooperstown, with its surrounding shores.
The story is placed as far back as the early French war, and
is one of Indian siege and ambuscade. Some of the night
scenes, where the beleagured whites, uncertain of the time
or mode of the enemy’s attack, wander up and down the
lake in the ark, listening for the dip of a paddle or the crackling
of a twig, to announce the approach of the foe, are unsurpassed
even by the earliest efforts of Mr. Cooper. The
rescue of Hist from the hostile camp is a scene of great
power—so is the surprise of the whites at the castle—and
so is the death of the Panther from Deerslayer’s hands, and
the latter’s temporary escape from the savages. The closing
scene, however, in which the torture of Deerslayer is going
on, seems to us not only painfully, but unnaturally protracted—so
that, long before the <span class='it'>dénouement</span>, we begin to
lose our interest in the finale, under the feeling that the
author has overworked his scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We are not captious in these few objections, for they are
but specks on a sunny sky. No one can question Mr.
Cooper’s powers as a novelist of his particular school. We
dismiss his work with high praise, hoping that he may long
live to adorn the literature of his country, and that he may
never write a worse story than the Deerslayer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Leather Stocking tales are now complete in ten volumes,
by Messrs. Lea and Blanchard.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>A Practical Description of Herron’s Patent Trellis Railway
Structure, etc., etc. By</span> <span class='sc'>James Herron</span>, <span class='it'>Civil
Engineer. 1 vol. Carey and Hart, and J. Dobson,
Philadelphia, 1841.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This is an able treatise. The main object of the author is
to explain his Patent Trellis Railway Structure—an invention
which is peculiarly adapted to the frosty climates of the
middle and northern states; but, as collateral to this, he has
discussed the subject of mineralizing wood, of an improved
method of joining the ends of railway bars, and of the defective
nature of railway structures in use.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The length to which we have extended some of the preceding
reviews, forbids us to go at large into the contents of this
volume; but we recommend it to the attention of the public,
and to that of rail-road companies in particular. The volume
is accompanied by four large plates of working plans
to illustrate the author’s remarks. The invention of Mr.
Herron has received the sanction of the very highest authorities,
and will, in our opinion, supercede all other modes of
railway structure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Strickland, so well known as an architect and engineer,
speaks of it as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Among the various methods now used for the super-structure
of railways in this country and in Europe, I know
of none to compare with Mr. Herron’s patent horizontal
truss, or diagonal braced floor. It has the great advantages
of surface-bearing lateral connection, and longitudinal combination
of strength, and evenness of level. It is calculated
to rest secure in all the various characters of soil .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. will be
found to resist with the utmost degree of permanency all the
vicissitudes of the caved and washed embankments which
undermine the present mud-sills and cross-ties of the road-beds
now in use.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Franklin Institute says of it:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Herron has fully understood and appreciated the
evils inseparably connected with the plans of railway super-structure
so much in use here and in Europe, in which the
rails are supported upon isolated blocks of stone or sleepers
of timber .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. His object has been to devise a plan in which
all the parts forming the structure shall be adequately supported;
while, at the same time, they shall be so connected
that no portion will be liable to independent displacement,
either laterally or vertically.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Sedgwick has given us, in these volumes, her notes
of travel through England, Italy, and other parts of Europe.
The book is written in an easy, almost conversational style;
it abounds in anecdote and what we should call allowable
gossip; and, if it were only a little racier, would be a model
for tourists. We like particularly the little details of persons
and manners, in which our author has indulged—one
gets, in perusing them, an excellent idea of the society in
other countries. This is what we want, and where the author
does not intrude on privacy, we cannot see that he or
she is to be condemned. Miss Sedgwick’s choice of words
might—to our minds—be purer: her style is often disfigured
by provincial phrases of the worst kind.</p>

<div><h1><a id='sec'></a>SECRET WRITING.</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>On</span> the tenth of August, a letter addressed to us by
some gentleman who had assumed the <span class='it'>nom de guerre</span> of
Timotheus Whackemwell, was received at this office, from
Baltimore. It enclosed a cypher, and says, “if you succeed
with it I will set you down as perfect in the art.” Thinking
that in the chirography we recognized the hand of our friend,
Mr. J. N. McJilton, of Baltimore, we addressed <span class='it'>him</span> by
return of mail, with the solution desired. Mr. McJilton, it
appears, however, was not the correspondent. The solution
ran thus—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This specimen of secret writing is sent you for explanation.
If you succeed in divining its meaning, I will believe
that you are some kin to Old Nick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Whackemwell, whoever or wherever he is, will acknowledge
this reading to be correct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cypher submitted through Mr. F. W. Thomas, by Dr.
Frailey, of Washington, and decyphered by us, also in return
of mail, as stated in our August number, has not yet
been read by any of our innumerable readers. We now
append its solution, together with the whole of that letter of
the Doctor’s, of which we gave only a portion in the August
number.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>SOLUTION.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>In one of those peripatetic circumrotations I obviated a
rustic whom I subjected to catachetical interrogation respecting
the nosocomical characteristics of the edifice to
which I was approximate. With a volubility uncongealed
by the frigorific powers of villatic bashfulness, he ejaculated
a voluminous replication from the universal tenor of
whose contents I deduce the subsequent amalgamation of
heterogeneous facts. Without dubiety incipient pretension
is apt to terminate in final vulgarity, as parturient mountains
have been fabulated to produce muscupular abortions.
The institution the subject of my remarks, has not been
without cause the theme of the ephemeral columns of
quotidian journals, and enthusiastic encomiations in conversational
intercourse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The key to this cipher is as follows—<span class='it'>But find this out
and I give it up</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The appended letter, however, from Dr. Frailey, will
show the means used by him to embarrass the reading.
Arbitrary characters were made to stand for <span class='it'>whole words</span>.
When we take this circumstance into consideration, with
other facts mentioned in the letter, and regard also the nonsensical
character of the phraseology employed, we shall be
the better enabled to appreciate the extreme difficulty of
the puzzle.</p>

<p class='noindent'>Dear Sir,</p>

<p class='pindent'>It gives me pleasure to state, that the reading by Mr. Poe,
of the cryptograph which I gave you a few days since for
transmission to him, is correct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am the more astonished at this, since for various words
of two, three and four letters, a distinct character was used
for each, in order to prevent the discovery of some of those
words, by their frequent repetition in a cryptograph of any
length and applying them to other words. I also used a
distinct character for the terminations <span class='it'>tion</span> and <span class='it'>sion</span>, and
substituted in every word where it was possible, some of
the characters above alluded to. Where the same word of
two of those letters occurred frequently, the letters of the
key phrase and the characters were alternately used, to
increase the difficulty.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
